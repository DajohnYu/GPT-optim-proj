We believe these are things that many would identify with and that it would be good to share with our many friends and fans out here. Yes, caring is sharing, they say. And we believe in sharing, caring and nourishing each other – not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well. Whether you are a parent or have friends or siblings who are parents, it is not difficult to tell how it takes a toll on parents whenever a child falls ill – double whammy when two or more fall sick together! And we all know that prevention is better than cure! But how do we go about “preventing”? **HERE COMES THE “HOW-TO” BITS: ** METHOD #1: WHAT GOES IN... MUST COME OUT When we were young, our parents used to say “eat dirty, grow up dirty”; which refers broadly to allowing ourselves to eat or be exposed to anything and allowing our bodies to build immunity accordingly to deal with any illnesses or adversity in life as we grow up. This philosophy may not hold as much truth for the kids today. However, eating well is still the very fundamental thing for good health. Put in the good stuff, and the body benefits. And the same can be said for the reverse… So, lesser sugar (when they get too hyper, we get too tired chasing them around) and ditch the deep-fried stuff (yeap, french fries included!). Trade the candies for immunity gummies and French fries for delicious probiotic chocolate balls (yes, there is such a thing!) – they make happy treats for kids; which tastes good and are good for their bodies. METHOD #2: IT ALL STARTS FROM THE HOME The apple does not fall far from the tree. There, so before you start yelling at your kids for any of their bad habits… (you know what we are gonna say here. So we shan’t go on… :p) Cultivate healthy habits from home, and lead by example. Have your meals on time, eat more vegetables and fruits, drink more water, spend lesser time on your iPad, sleep early, blah blah. You know it all. The reality is, sometimes it is tough, after a full day at work, we just want to cut ourselves some slack – and not do the “good stuff” that we should be doing. But when we choose to snack on cookies and chips, binge on netflix series, or just laze on the couch and put off that needed shower; we are telling the kids that these are “good behavior” (despite what we say to them with our mouths!). So, maybe it’s time to take a hard look at yourself and see if there are some changes that need to take place; starting with yourself. #toughlove A simple place to start is to stock up on immunity boosters for the family. If the kids are still young, it’s a good idea to start them off on quality probiotics. Also have some emergency supplies handy for that occasional cough and sore throat. METHOD #3: YOU GOTTA MOVE IT, MOVE IT Spend time outdoors and get some fresh air! Go for a walk as a family; or if you are up for it, level up and go for a jog, maybe even cycling and swimming. Exercising helps to keep the body healthy and more resilient to viruses and illnesses; it’s one of the best ways to boost immunity. Not to mention the obvious, exercising as a family is also excellent bonding time! And if that sounds too boring, start flossing (the dance, not the teeth!) together with the kids – get them to teach you the moves! Have some fun while doing that. Who cares if you look goofy.

The initial taste was a bit interesting but very acceptable. Leaves quite a nice cooling feeling even after brushing and teeth generally feels whiter and shinier. A pretty good product.

Observations suggest that the rate of balding progression may also be slowed by the use of this product. ReGro has developed high-quality formulas to battle concerns such as struggling hair growth. Clinically proven to help regrow hair, this solution will last approximately 40 days upon using. Made in Indonesia DIRECTIONS: Adult (18 to 65 years): Apply one dose of 7 sprays (1ml) of ReGro two times a day, preferably morning and night, to the areas of baldness or hair loss. This dose should be used regardless of the size of the bald area. Do not exceed two doses (14sprays or 2ml) per day. Massage scalp gently with fingertips after each spray. Wash hands well after use. The method for application as follow: 1. For large area of the scalp, use the pump sprayer. Aim and press the pump towards the center of the balding area. Spread gently with fingertips to cover all the balding areas. 2. For small areas or areas under hair, use the extended tip applicator. Pull the pump sprayer head out and fit the extended tip applicator firmly onto the spray shaft. Aim and press the pump towards the center of the balding area. Spread gently with fingertips to cover all the balding areas. ReGro should be applied to completely dry hair and scalp. Used only on healthy and intact skin. Do not wash hair or wet the scalp at least 4 hours after application. Onset and degree of hair growth stimulation vary among individuals.

Natural anti-inflammatory relief, non-steroidal and rich in Omega 3,6 & 9 fatty acids, Vitamins K, E and A. It contains 100% pure free-range emu oil by No. 1 Australian manufacturer of pure emu oil products. BENEFITS: • Pure Emu Oil is natural, non-toxic, non-comedogenic (meaning that it does not clog pores), hypo-allergenic (non-irritating) and is gentle for all skin types. • Anti Bacterial – Pure emu oil will help stop the growth of bacteria in wounded skin, preventing it from spreading. • Anti-inflammatory – with effects comparable to ibuprofen, brings down the swelling and inflammation of rosacae & eczema. • Pain relief - It is effective in reducing pain and quickly healing all types of burns including sunburn, first and second degree burns and burns caused from radiation therapy. • Antioxidant - As well as a known skin cell regenerator and anti-wrinkle agent which helps to improve the condition of aging skin. It also calms the surface and keeps the skin from scarring after having laser resurfacing or chemical peels. Made in Australia HOW TO USE: Using your hands apply onto the desired area. Apply more emu oil if needed to cover entire area. You do not need to rub the oil all the way in since this emu oil is a penetrating oil and will absorb into the skin on its own. The skin should not feel oily when you are finished. If it does, you have probably used too much. Simply reduce the amount that you use next time.

Thanks to this stimulation of the blood circulation, there is an increase in the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the papilla and follicle • Provides optimal growth conditions for strong and healthy hair • Continuous application over several months will lead to visible results: reduced hair loss and healthier hair.

Paraben-free, Sulfate-free, fragrance-free, etc… We see these labels on most of our skincare products, but what do they mean exactly and how do they impact our skin? PARABENS = PRESERVATIVES Parabens help stop the growth of bacteria, fungus and other potentially harmful microbes; it is used widely as preservatives in lotions, deodorants, shampoos, shaving cream, and many other skin-care products. The most common Parabens that you will find on product labels are butylparaben, methylparaben, and propylparaben, so be sure to look out for these the next time you go shopping! The big debate over Paraben is that has been linked (although not conclusively) to breast cancer. It is said that it gets absorbed into the body and is known to interfere with and mimic estrogen; disturbing the hormonal balance in the body. It’s also known as a leading cause of skin irritation, dermatitis, and premature skin ageing (premature ageing? A definite no-no!) PLANT-BASED PRESERVATIVES – A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO PARABENS: It is better to be mindful in choosing our skin care essentials and choose Paraben-free products to give our skin the glow it needs, but without the negative long-term side effects of chemical preservatives. Paraben-free products usually contain either ethylhexylglycerin (plant-derived preservative) or phenoxyethanol (naturally derived ether alcohol). Here are two products that are paraben free without compromising on the beauty benefits: Ceramiracle First Light The Reboot Mask is a nutrient-rich, anti-aging clay mask that gently revitalizes, purifies and exfoliates your skin to give it a brightening boost. It combines a mixture of rare black volcanic sand and traditional Korean botanical extract (Korean rice water, anti-aging ginseng and mugwort) to restore the balance of your delicate skin. Ceramiracle products are cruelty-free and vegetarian-friendly; and do not contain any harsh chemicals, parabens, SLS/SLES, sulfates, mineral oils, synthetic or artificial dyes or phthalates. (Ps: we tried it and we loved it). Auolive Day Glower is a lightweight, non-greasy antioxidant day moisturiser which protects the skin from premature ageing and UV rays damage. Enriched with a luxurious blend of natural active ingredients like Ginkgo Bilbao Leaf Extract and Squalene, the skin receives the moisture and nourishment it needs to stay soft, supple and healthy. Auolive products are dermatologically and clinically tested, non-allergenic, paraben, alcohol and color free (The founder’s absolutely passionate about her products and so you can trust that loads of thoughts have gone into the formulation!) SLS, SLES, ALL THE BUZZ AND WHAT ARE THEY EXACTLY? Sulfates are substances that are found widely in products like facial wash, shampoo, and toothpastebut also in laundry detergents too! It’s typically used to add “foam” and remove oil from hair and skin, acting like a “degreaser”; which generally works well to “cleanse”. However, it also means that in the process of “cleansing”, natural oils and the protective layers of the skin gets stripped off, which can cause irritation to the skin. Sulfate and two of its main ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Ether Sulfate (SLES) are linked to a multitude of skin and hair problems since they have to corrode (damage or destroy!) in order to be useful. Because of this, sulfates may possibly leave you with problems like dry, irritated skin, rough and brittle hair, redness and dryness in the scalp, and for some, acne and eczema! RECOMMENDED SULFATE-FREE PRODUCTS: For those with sensitive skin, it may be a good idea to look for sulfate-free cleansers and shampoos. Sulfate-free products are made out of natural oils that seek to replace the SLS and SLES content in soaps. They also help to remove bacteria and prevent the dirt build-up. For instance, Sukin Botanical Body Wash from Australia is enriched with aromatic botanical oils that gently cleanse, soften and purify your skin. Free from sulfate and paraben, this hydrating body wash is filled with jojoba, avocado, and rosehip—aromatherapeutic oils that rejuvenate your tired body minus the known irritations you would otherwise get with sulfate-filled products. Another big fave worth trying is the Original Sprout Natural Shampoo which is infused with calendula, rosemary and aloe. This nourishing shampoo promises to detangle hair effortlessly without corroding or destroying hair roots, leaving you with hydrated hair after every wash! Unlike shampoos with sulfate chemicals that can strip away your hair moisture, it contains organic emollients that nourish and protect your scalp from redness and dryness. What is FRAGRANCE & how harmful is that? Hold up. Fragrance? As in… smell? What could possibly be wrong with that! As it turns out, A LOT. Fragrance is known to contain many allergens and irritants. Ever noticed how you sometimes sneeze non-stop when greeted with a scent that your body “rejects”? Now, imagine that happening on your skin; which typically translates as flare-ups and inflammation… and that usually happens when products that are being used contains substances that are not “skin identical”. If you have a skin type that’s sensitive, or you have skin conditions like eczema, rosacea, or psoriasis, it is extremely beneficial to eliminate allergens and irritants from your daily regime. RECOMMENDED FRAGRANCE-FREE PRODUCTS: A trusted brand by many with sensitive skin, Ego QV Cream replenishes the skin by pounding on squalene, a natural component in our skin’s natural oil. This is especially helpful to the driest areas of our bodies, like elbows, knees, and hands. Free from fragrance, color, and other skin allergens, Ego QV products are suitable for skin conditions such as dry scaly skin, itchiness, dermatitis and can be used to relief symptoms of atopic eczema and psoriasis. Suitable for infants as well as the elderly. A favourite amongst parents, Ceradan Soap-Free Moisturizing Wash, contains ceramides—which are natural lipids that bind skin cells together and comprise a major component of the skin’s surface structure. People suffering from skin conditions which make the skin dry, sensitive and inflamed are often low in ceramides. Irritated skin usually has a compromised protective barrier, which leaves it vulnerable to being affected by various environmental irritants. Ceradan products are laboratory tested and verified to be hypoallergenic. They contain no fragrance, colors, parabens, steroids. They are safe for use at all ages, from newborns to the very elderly and are suitable for both facial and bodily use. Now that you know your ABCs of the labels on your skincare products, make sure to include these recommended products in your cart and keep a lookout for the harsh chemicals listed above. This will help to get you and your family healthy and naturally gorgeous skin. Join Mailing List For 10% Off Stay gorgeous and healthy with the widest range of supplements and vitamins from Glovida!

This is my go-to probiotic that I take whenever I have any stomach upset or feel bloated. Works wonders....my girl loves it too!! :) ROY S 2021-06-24 Probiotics that works! Been taking this daily for good digestion, taste great and works! Whenever i have diarrhoea or stomachache, Lactomin never fails with 3-4 sachets at one go. The diarrhoea stops and stomachache goes away in a short time. This shows the product works! Highly recommend for good digestion and immunity. Celia Toh 2021-06-22 recommended by the pharmacist this is a good quality probiotic. it is very tasty. my kids are taking lactokids also. good brand. Elizabeth Lim 2021-06-15 Works really well for diarrhoea and constipation Works every time there is a stomach upset. Lactomin is now a staple at home given how it works so well for every tummy upset, does not require refrigeration and best of all, the kids enjoy taking them simply because they taste so good. Sage Lee 2021-06-11 love that it can be kept in room temperature so much more practical. and i will remember to eat them cos i can see them! i have tried with the other brands which require refrigeration and it just doesnt work... out of sight out of mind... Candy 2020-05-22 Lactomin Good tasting probiotics. It's my first time trying. Mary 2020-03-16 Useful supplement, good price Was prescribed this by GP for upset tummy/bloat. Liked how it works and taste, so decided to continue long-term. Glad to find it here and at a reasonable price. Thanks! Serene Ong 2017-08-07 Great for travelling! Grab and go! A friend recommended Lactomin, not many probiotic brands come in sachet packaging. Personally i love sachet packaged products, the ease of travelling with it! You don't need to bring the whole bottle or worry about repackaging tablets. It is so well packed and freshly sealed! My family and i have been taking Lactomin, and it is soooo good! Wiped out all my digestive problems! Highly recommend! Xie Liping 2017-08-07 Well Done Lactomin! My 7 year old daughter loves taking lactomin! She just can't stop popping lactomin! Good thing it a supplement, if not i will be in trouble. She takes once a day, sometimes twice. I have seen her gut improved as she does everything with ease and daily. The taste is so good, she says its like taking ""Horlicks sweet!"" With a healthy digestive system taken care of, she can focus on her priorities. Rick Clay 2017-08-07 Recommended by my GP, Relieved all my digestive problems! A friend told me about this after I told her of my digestive problems. I was not sure I wanted to take on a daily basis. But when my GP agreed I should be taking them. I decided to give it a shot. I have now been taking Lactomin daily for about 2 years and what a difference it really makes! My digestive problems are all gone! Charmaine Kris 2017-08-07 Improved my immunity and my kids love it too! I started taking this about half a year ago and it's been really good. My overall health has improved and I feel alot better. I recommend for everyone....my kids also take it and love it. Especially the taste! Asher Chan 2017-08-07 High quality at affordable price! After spending so much money and so much time trying expensive probiotic products, I finally purchased Lactomin about a 2 weeks ago. I was surprised at how quickly it began to work! I take one in the morning, and all is well! Best part it is priced reasonably and cheaper than other probiotic brands, plus it works as well, if not even better!"" Johnson Yap 2017-08-07 Highly recommend Lactomin! Taste good too! For over 5 years my digestive tract has been like a volatile stock market. Then a year ago, my aunt said that she was having a problem with her digestive tract and she had started taking Lactomin probiotics daily, and she felt so much better. So, I tried them, and after 5 years of my digestive tract controlling me, I finally got in control of my digestive tract. I love this product. It taste so good and works great. Make sure you drink water after taking the powder probiotics! Ryan 2017-07-01 Great-tasting probiotics, convenient to carry around Was first introduced to this by my doctor. Find it very easy to bring around, tastes really good too. MH Wong 2017-06-08 My kids love the taste of this! Very handy to bring for travels (no need for refrigeration), really works (for constipation or diarrhoea) and most importantly, kids love the taste!

Cheaper than everywhere and fast delivery. SS Tan 2021-06-30 Gentleness you can feel immediately! Have been looking around for a gentle cleanser that does not dry up the skin... and fell in love with this immediately. Nice scent and so gentle on the skin.... can feel the effects almost immediately! Huey Huey 2021-06-14 Love Isoderm My husband has very sensitive skin - was grateful to friend who has recommended us Isoderm. He has no complain since then :) Geraldine Lim 2021-06-05 My family and I have been using Isoderm for years! I have tried all kinds of cleansers. Most are just too drying in the long run..and those that are for sensitive skin are too mild and do not form a lather (so there's always this feeling like you havent quite finished bathing:P) Isoderm lathers well, is not drying and it is suitable for sensitive, eczema-prone skin (like my daughter's) and really keeps the skin moisture locked in. Never felt the need to change cleansers since we started Isoderm. Denise Tay 2021-02-04 Good buy Delivered promptly in good conditions. Good product for dry skin. Jelin 2020-07-28 Isoderm is gentle and healing Was recommended to Isoderm by my doctor as a face wash 4 years ago. Subsequently use it as a body wash too as was thinking since it is so gentle even for the face, why not on body. It helps soothe my urticaria, keeping my skin moist yet smooth feel. Since then I recommended isoderm to a few friends who have eczema issues and it helps soothe the problem too. Poppy 2017-10-30 Best liquid cleanser for eczema skin My son has had eczema since he was little and it has got worse through the years with his track and field and football. He's 18 and at the moment, he's just managing the condition as he just can't give up his sports. One doctor recommended Isoderm about 2 years ago and he's been using this since. Having tried so many products, he feels this liquid cleanser works best for him and it's most soothing. The only drawback - it's $25 for a 500ml bottle at the pharmacies! So, when I managed to get this at $17 per bottle at Glovida, I jumped on it. I'm just glad I found Glovida and the best part, I get the items in a matter of 2 days or so. So, why not! Esther 2017-08-21 Gentle for my sensitive skin I love how this product is able to use for both face and body. It's really convenient for me to use the same product without the need to stock up 2 products for different usage. It also cleanses effectively and I can use it at ease without worrying allergic reaction Esther 2017-07-04 Best cleanser ever This is by far the best cleanser. Am glad to have found it here. We stock up on this at home and thus, the savings with orders of 3 or more works really well for us. pearlball 2017-05-08 Great! Was introduced to isoderm by my dermatologist 10 years ago. It was great, and I introduced to my family. It has hence become the favourite for us! Glad to find this website and enjoy amazing saving! Life is Good! 2017-02-01 My all-time favourite I was first introduced to this several years ago by my family doctor. Absolutely love it! My entire family uses this, and I am so glad to have found this here. Hard to find outside and the superb price here really helps in savings, especially for a family staple like this! Mr. K Chung 2016-12-19 my family uses this my family uses this. it's great. Lisa 2016-07-28 Isoderm is a great product. Been looking hi and low for this...glad you have this stocked and at a good price. Related Products PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.

Ahhhhh… the glee of finding great buys online! The internet era has reshaped the way we live and shop. And as we become more comfortable with navigating our ways around the digital arena, it is important that we are equally savvy about purchasing our supplements and vitamins online as well. We have crafted a checklist below to help you out on this! 1.ESTABLISHED BRANDS Say you’ve scoured the internet and landed on a website that promises out-of-the-world benefits on some vitamins or supplement. You might think that you have discovered the latest wonder in science and health! However, it is better to take a step back and find out a little more about the product claims made; especially if it is a brand that you have never seen or heard before. Check the countries of origin and manufacturers and also the ingredients used in these products. It is important to check the authenticity of the products so you don’t end up with counterfeit products. It is a safer bet to buy your items from online stores that have established their niches in the medical retail industry and purchase directly from them to ensure that you’re buying high quality products and saving yourself from falling prey to shady third party-distributors. 2.PRICING On a related note to point 1, when you stumble upon a retailer that offers prices that are too good to be true, know that it probably is. Remember that the online stores are running a business, very much the same as retail stores. Often, prices are more competitive in the online space as online retailers save on rental costs in the retail space. However, when the prices are set too low, something probably has to give, in order to make ends meet for the business. It could be compromised product quality, storage conditions, product delivery, etc. Buy from an online retailer with reasonable and competitive pricing that offers value in the entire distribution chain. That will give you a better peace of mind in getting good products and good service. 3.ORGANIC REVIEWS & RECOMMENDATIONS In making online purchases, most of us typically scroll through online reviews. People weigh products based on others’ experiential testimonies; which is a rather commonplace thing to do. When going through these reviews, take note that a long review list may not always be a determinant of quality; look instead for organic or “real reviews”; aka reviews that come from actual people and not trolls (or those mean, faceless, cubes floating around the internet these days, ready to pounce at even the most trustworthy of brands). Other than product reviews, note what people say about other aspects of their purchase experience with the e-commerce sites; such as turnaround time (more on that later), packing, service, processing, shipping, etc. These are just as important as the product itself since these things say a lot about the dependability of your chosen online retailers. 4.TURNAROUND OR PROCESSING TIME Turnaround time is an especially vital point to consider. Look for online retailers who are able to articulate clearly the expected turnaround time, especially for local deliveries. Completing an order form is just step 1 of the entire process of an online order. An established store would have their inventory in check and stock on hand to complete the delivery promptly. They should also be able to keep customers informed of the status of their orders at every point of delivery. 5.QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS Marketing has changed a lot since the early days of the internet. Influencers now play a big part in endorsing products and introducing new brands to the consumers. When it comes to healthcare, however, it is more important to ensure that there are qualified professionals, (eg. an in-house pharmacist) behind a store that specializes in selling health supplements. You would want to have a reliable source to turn to if you have any queries with your purchases and know that you are getting advice that you can trust. In this way, you get value and quality with your purchases as you are supported not just with good products to purchase, but also relevant health advice that you need when purchasing off a site selling health related products. 6.CONSISTENCY AND DEPENDABILITY Find a shop that is dependable and consistently provide good value and service. As well as one which is constantly offering new products and new ways to better your health. Unlike fashion, which keeps changing, with health care, you'd want a platform which is reliable and one which is able to meet your needs by listening to your feedback for new products and any health-related requests. Search for an online retailer who can partner with you through your health journey and have them support you and be a source you can turn to for support as well!

Christmas brings a special warmth to our hearts. With vacations, feasting, and celebrations with family and loved ones; carols and festive décor decking every mall and house that you visit; very few holidays hold the same enchantment as Christmas. For many, it is also a time when we show our appreciation for the people in our lives, in a very tangible way, with gifts. For the busy bees out there, we know this can get overwhelming with the long list of gifts to prepare. So, in the spirit of giving and sharing, we have put together a little Glovida Christmas Gift Guide below to make it easy for you to pick up items that are practical, of good quality and great value. We will throw in some Christmas gift tags for you as well to make it all more seamless, so you can enjoy the reason for the season. GLOVIDA CHRISTMAS GIFT GUIDE Type 1: The Vain Pot *We all know one (or more!) of them. ;) Gift her (or him!) with anything that makes her look and feel prettier! * Budget	  Gift ideas Below $20	Face masks Body Mist $25 and up	Hair care products Body Scrubs/Moisturizers $40 and up	Sunscreen products $18 and up	Beauty supplements Type 2: The Fuss Pot This is for the the ones who seem to know it all and have it all, who seem to have no need for anything and are sooo difficult to please. You probably spend the most time cracking your head on what to get them. The way to please and impress them is to get them stuff of good quality, that cannot be easily found on the mass retail shelves. This would give them some bragging rights and make their Christmas a little merrier. Budget	Gift Ideas $20 and up	Vasse Virgin moisturisers $40 and up	Recherche $50 and up	Auolive $60 and up 	Ceramiracle Type 3: The Boss This is a tricky one... you would want to play it safe and get something tasteful with a touch of class. Earn some brownie points! Budget	Gift Ideas $20 and up	Quality body cleansers $30 and up 	Hand lotion $40 and up	Vasse Virgin Diffusers ** Type 4: The Jetsetter** The one who is always out of town and spends more time on the road than back at home. The one whom you have difficulty keeping tabs of their whereabouts. While the jetsetting lifestyle might seem enviable to some, these frequent flyers need some TLC for the body as the intense travelling could take a toll on their bodies. Budget	Gift Ideas Below $20 	Body Mists (which doubles up as a room spray too!) $20 and up 	Body massage oils to knead those tired muscle knots away $40 and up 	Suncare and skin brighteners (yes, this is very much needed!) Ceramiracle first light reboot mask Type 5: The Colleagues The people that you meet everyday at work and whom you work closely with (but yet not close enough to be BFFs). You want to show some appreciation by getting them something nice (but not too expensive!). In this instance, a little goes a long way... so you can continue on a good working relationship for the new year. Budget	Gift Ideas Below $20 	Utena face masks Body Mist (to use after lunch!) $20 and up	Body scrubs/ Moisturizers Shampoo/Conditioner ** Type 6: The Guys** *This one is a toughie. They do not seem to care about receiving any gifts. And yet, you can't get past yourself to not get them anything. So, something that they could use in their daily lives would probably work well. * Budget	Gift Ideas $10 and up 	Coconut oil $40 and up	Sunscreen products ** Type 7: The Parents** Ahhhh... our lovely parents. The ones who love us so dearly but gets on our nerves so badly sometimes. As they move into their sunset years, getting them stuff that helps them keep healthy would be a gesture that they would greatly appreciate. Budget	Gift Ideas $15 and up 	Digestive health supplement $40 and up 	Fish oil supplement Type 8 : Secret Santa Can’t run away from this! Can’t go too sloppy either. 'Cos everyone will open their presents in front of everyone! And you don’t want to look like you didn’t make any effort for the celebration… The savvy choice will be to get a general crowd pleaser. (without breaking the bank) Budget	Gift Ideas $10 to $30 and up 	Facial oils, Massage oils, body mists, body scrub Make use of the tips provided here to get your Christmas gifting sorted and spread some good cheer this yuletide. Enjoy the season of Christmas and take this time not just to celebrate, but also to reflect and be thankful for the year that has passed.

Fess Children’s Saline Nasal Spray is a non medicated nasal spray that offers a natural way to relieve kids’ blocked nose. It is made from micro-filtered seawater and relieves sinus and nasal congestion brought on by allergies, colds, and sinusitis. It effectively manages children’s allergies by stimulating the nose’s natural defences and calming sinus and nasal cavity inflammation by breaking down the mucus. Finally, this product helps wash away dust, pollen, and other allergens. Fess Children’s Saline Nasal Spray is safe and free from preservatives and harmful chemicals, promoting better nasal health for kids! BENEFITS: • Naturally relieves congestion by thinning and clearing excess mucus. • Protects from dust and other pollutants, especially allergens that cause hay fever. • Promotes and strengthens nasal health by neutralising the acidity in the sinus cavity. • Softens dried blood for post-operative care so as not to irritate sinus passages. Made in France DIRECTIONS: Use 2-3 sprays per nostril as needed. Direct the nozzle into the right nostril. Angle the nozzle away from the centre of the nose pointing towards the right ear. Press the spray pump 2 or 3 times. Repeat in the left nostril. EXPIRY DATE: 30-May-2024 Rating & Reviews 5 /5 3 Ratings Love our product?

It does not taste medicinal but is just as soothing to the throat. I purchased the Black Elderberry version and simply love its tangy flavor.

We have made it easier for you by coming up with this list of essential supplements that you should pack into your luggage for your next trip. Make sure you add them to the checklist when packing for your next flight out! 1. IMMUNITY BOOSTERS Falling sick while on vacation is no fun! What more with all the exciting things that you have on the itinerary, you would definitely want to stay healthy in order to enjoy your long-awaited break! Keep your immunity in check, and give a boost to your energy levels with Berocca Performance Orange Flavour Effervescent Tablets! For some, it is helpful in dealing with jetlag! This immunity booster is formulated with Vitamin B and C, plus essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc. It’s dissolved in water and builds up people’s immune system across age group. Plus, it tastes yummy too! Alternatively, Sambucol Cold & Flu Forte Elderberry Capsules help to build your immune defenses and reduces the risk of catching the common cold wherever you go. It is formulated not only to fight and provide relief from the symptoms of cold and flu; it also acts as a powerful support to one’s natural immune function. Every capsule has concentrated black elderberry, combined with the immune supporting ingredients of Vitamins C and Zinc. 2. THROAT LOZENGES Cough is one of the most common illnesses that can strike when travelling. Thus, it’s essential to equip yourself with lozenges that can soothe your throat effectively! Elderberry has been studied for its ability to remedy the common cold and flu. The fruit is a rich source of antioxidants and have, on its own, been proven to treat a whole load of health problems like constipation, sinus infections, and even hay fever. This main ingredient is what makes Sambucol Black Elderberry Lozenges so effective! This supplement is bursting with the enticing flavour of black elderberry and has combative properties that’s been proven to be anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, and anti-inflammation. Additionally, it provides relief from sore throat and is packed with antioxidants, plus Vitamin C and Zinc, that helps support the immune system. People on vacation are often wary of taking medicines during their trips for fear of drowsing and missing out. With Leftose 30s Tablets for Chesty Coughs and Sore Throats, you can leave all these worries behind as it contains a non-drowsy formula! It’s made up of lysozyme, a natural enzyme that contains anti-inflammatory and mucolytic properties that provide fast relief from sore throats and chesty coughs. What it does is that it breaks down hard-to-remove phlegm, allowing one to cough it out easily. With its effectiveness in relieving discomfort and swelling caused by sore throat, this supplement will come in handy when one falls ill while travelling! 3. PROBIOTICS When we travel to different places, one of the best ways to soak up the local culture is to enjoy local delicacies! As much as we want to stuff ourselves with delicious food, there’s that chance we could get adverse reaction to some stuff. So, one of the most important supplements on our list is probiotics which can help to prevent and cure uncomfortable digestives disorders. Lacteol Fort is a great probiotic that takes care of our gut health by providing effective relief from acute, chronic, and Traveler’s diarrhea. It has the powerful Lactobacillus acidophilus LB Strain 10 billion that prevents diarrhea and improve symptoms of IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Another robust probiotic supplement is LactoGG. LactoGG’s effectiveness is well-researched; it boasts over 700 scientific papers and 200 clinical trials under its belt. The overwhelming support for its claims of health benefits is traced to its powerful probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG, which prevents constipation and provides relief from all kinds of diarrhea. Aside from gut-related benefits, LactoGG also contributes to stronger immune systems (for both adults and children) and lowers the risk of contracting infections across age group. Already a good, stand-alone product, LactoGG is also packed with bio-therapeutic qualities that make it an ideal complementary supplement to various medical treatments. 4. SUNBLOCK With or without the excuse for vacation, it’s important that we take supplements and products that protect us against harmful ultra violet rays. Good thing we have Heliocare Ultra Oral in our repository! Boasting over 40 published studies and very convincing collaborations with Harvard Medical School as well as experts in the field of sun protection, Heliocare Ultra Oral contains Fernblock as its key ingredient, a robust antioxidant that reduces the existence of free radicals by up to 50%. Never be afraid of stepping out into and enjoying the sun again; this supplement provides an entire skin surface protection that blankets your entire skin from UV rays and increases our skin’s resistance against sunburn, too! Not only does it do wonders for your skin, it also contains lycopene, lutein, vitamins C and E, which have the ability to protect your eyes from UV rays. Another supplement that can provide the essential sun protection you need is the Ceramiracle Invi-Sun Skin Defense Supplement. It provides long lasting protection against the sun’s rays, protecting our skin from prolonged sun exposure without the negative effects. What this supplement does is that it strengthens the skin’s natural resilience and protective barriers which allows us to withstand up to 56% more UV rays. It’s powered by NutroxSun, a component from Spain, that actively builds up the skin’s resistance. This oral sunblock also helps to reduce skin redness with its grapefruit and rosemary extracts. So, relish that local delicacy, bask in the sun longer, and sing your heart out wherever! Whatever you do, never shy away from the adventure that awaits you during your vacations again by taking these 4 essential supplements wherever you go! Join Mailing List For 10% Off!

For those with skin conditions such as eczema, ceramide levels are markedly reduced in the correct 3:1:1 ratio of intercellular physiological lipids (ceramide, cholesterol, free fatty acids). Ceradan® repair Cream contains a large concentration of ceramides. Ceramides are natural lipids which bind skin cells together and comprise a major component of the skin’s surface structure. People suffering from skin conditions which make the skin dry, sensitive and inflamed are often low in ceramides. Irritated skin usually has a compromised protective barrier, which leaves it vulnerable to being affected by various environmental irritants. BENEFITS: • Mildly acidic pH levels inhibit skin serine proteases from breaking down the skin barrier. • Laboratory tested and verified to be hypoallergenic. • Suitable for both facial and bodily use. • Safe for use at all ages, from newborns to the very elderly. • Contains no: Parabens, steroids, Lanolin, colours, fragrance or plant-derived squalene. Developed in Japan, Made in Singapore DIRECTIONS: Apply twice daily or as many times as needed. EXPIRY DATE: 30-May-2024 If you have any questions about the ideal use of this scientifically formulated cream, its benefits, ingredients or anything else, feel free to fill in an online enquiry form. Our representatives will be happy to help. Alternatively, you can call us on +65 9484 3356 for assistance. Rating & Reviews 5 /5 6 Ratings Love our product?

Flexiseq worked in reducing knee pain but need to be applied long term which raised issue of affordability versus an injection of synovial fluid. If Flexiseq is priced lower it will definitely be a viable alternative to synovial injection. Benjamin 2019-03-07 Recommended This is a good topical application for joints.

What to know and 10 brands to try Skincare supplements and collagen drinks have been around for a while, but the edible beauty trend has only really taken off recently, with more and more brands jumping on the eat-your-skincare bandwagon, and consumers very ready to swallow the promises of glowing skin and lush locks brought on by imbibing supplements. With the increasing obsession with wellness and health, and changes in lifestyle brought on by the pandemic, people are looking for new ways of helping their bodies (including their skin and hair) cope, and remain in optimum condition. Interestingly, many of these beauty supplements are from skincare labels, rather than brands more traditionally known for vitamins. Skincare and hair supplements, like health supplements, bring extra vitamins and minerals to the table, adding nutrients that may be missing from our diets. They compress into tiny pills and easy-to-consume sachets various foods and ingredients that may be difficult for us to regularly add to our meals, with the aim of contributing to better health and improved looks, from the inside out. The modern urbanite is cottoning on to the reality that a multi-pronged and holistic approach will help in bringing forth that million-dollar glow – this includes great skincare products, a regimented diet, facials and treatments, and beauty products you can eat. They compress into tiny pills and easy-to-consume sachets various foods and ingredients that may be difficult for us to regularly add to our meals. Of course, as with anything you put on your face or into your body, caution is advised.

It helps to drain fluids from the nasal mucosa, safely clearing the nose because of its immediate decongestant action. It is recommended for babies from 3 months and children. Sterimar Baby Blocked Nose is a hypertonic filtered sea water solution, 100% natural, drug and preservative free. Rich in mineral salts and marine trace elements with copper and manganese, which is known for their anti-infectious and anti-allergic properties, as well as their importance in cell metabolism. Sterimar Baby Hypertonic has been specially designed for the delicate noses of babies over 3 months and children: the salt content of the hypertonic sea water solution and the pressure of the spray have been developed to respect the nasal mucosa. BENEFITS: • Provide natural relief from nasal congestion (common colds, rhinopharyngitis, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis) • Contribute to reducing bacterial growth • Eliminate even thick mucus • Help to fight cold and limit the risks of secondary infection by washing out nasal cavities. • Recommended for babies from 3 months Made in France CONTENTS: Sea water, copper & manganese salt, purified water. DIRECTIONS: On first use, spray once to start the system. Gently insert the nozzle into the nostril. Spray briefly 1 to 2 times in each nostril. Let any excess solution flow out before wiping the nose. For a deeper cleansing of nasal cavities: 1) Place the baby under 2 years old lying on his back or sitting up from the age of 2. 2) Baby's head tilted to the side, gently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril. 3) Press the nozzle for approximately 2 seconds. Let any excess solution flow out of the other nostril then wipe the nose. 4) Repeat the operation in the other nostril if necessary. After each use, clean the nozzle with soapy water and dry. Use 2 to 6 times a day or more until decongestion. EXPIRY DATE: 31-Aug-2025 Rating & Reviews 5 /5 2 Ratings Love our product?

I find that prolonged use of it really makes the skin a lot better, smoother and less dry. I haven't used any other brands ever since I found Isoderm. I usually use the 500ml pump, but this smaller size comes in handy for travels. especially to cold climates where the skin becomes even more dry and my kids dont take well to the dry hotel soaps. Patrick 2016-11-14 Was finding it hard to find this outside Finally found it here. Very good price too. My family has been using this for years. Lindy 2016-10-21 By far, my most favourite body cleanser I honestly swear by this product. It is REALLY GOOD. Leaves a super nice moisturized feel after a bath and my skin has really improved over years of using this.

The 3 superfruits - Kakadu Plum, Illawarra Plum and Burdekin Plum are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants, to liven up dull skin tones and strengthen the skin’s defence against environmental stressors. The natural AHA from Lime Pearl gently exfoliates for a brightened skin-smoothing complexion. Topped off with Niacinamide, Tranexamic Acid and Licorice, to further calm redness, brighten uneven skin tones and fade dark spots over time. Oil-free, silicone-free and fragrance-free, this potent formula is proven to be effective without chemically harsh whitening agents. The fluid texture rejuvenates lacklustre skin to deliver a translucent youthful glow with persistent use. KEY INGREDIENTS: • Kakadu Plum: The Kakadu Plum is touted as the most concentrated natural source of Vitamin C on earth, containing an average of 55 times the Vitamin C found in oranges. Its superior brightening abilities effectively targets dullness and hyperpigmentation for a more radiant and even complexion. The Kakadu Plum is also an antioxidant powerhouse, which protects your skin against premature aging caused by environmental damage. • Illawarra Plum: The Illawarra Plum is packed with anthocyanins, a potent antioxidant that protects your skin from free radical damage and fights signs of ageing. • Burdekin Plum: In addition to high levels of Vitamin C and antioxidants, the Burdekin Plum is also rich in skin-balancing minerals such as Zinc, Magnesium, Calcium and Potassium. • Lim Pearl: Lime Pearl is a natural source of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), which gently removes pore-clogging debris and promotes natural cell turnover, for a visibly clearer and smoother complexion. • Niacinamide: Niacinamide is a long-time favorite ingredient of ours, due to its versatility and multiple benefits for skin. Not only does it brighten and prevent hyperpigmentation, it also minimises the appearance of pores, balances oil production and strengthens the skin barrier. • Licorice Root: Licorice Root offers anti-inflammatory effects to soothe sensitive skin and reduce redness. It also helps to diffuse existing melanin in the skin and inhibits the production of melanin, which fades existing dark spots and prevents the formation of new ones. • Tranexamic Acid & Alpha Arbutin: Tranexamic Acid is definitely one of the well-deserving IT ingredients of 2021. It is a gentle yet powerful amino acid clinically proven to reduce hyperpigmentation. It works well with Alpha Arbutin, another ingredient that diminishes the look of dark spots, sun-spots, discolouration and post-acne marks. Together, they are the perfect team to boost overall brightness of skin, all while being very gentle on skin. Made in Taiwan HOW TO USE: After cleansing and toning, dispense 1-2 drops of Plumicious Brightening Serum and gently pat onto slightly damp face and neck until fully absorbed. Follow with moisturizer to seal everything in place. Apply daily, AM and PM. Keep in a cool, dry place, away from direct light.

Mrs Wong 2017-05-05 My favourite sunscreen so far I was always switching brands prior to using the Heliocare 360 partly because many of the sunblocks result in clogged/oily pores. This has worked very well for me and I am a lot more confident that it protects me from getting freckles and age spots which are dreadful.

Why is everyone talking about probiotics and what does it do for your body? Scientific evidence has shown a strong correlation between probiotics and the gut health of young children. Probiotics play a crucial role in regulating one’s digestion and intestinal function. We’ve gathered some valuable insights from parents and trusted pharmacists to create a guide on what probiotics are, their benefits for your child and the top 5 brands that are popular among parents: WHAT ARE PROBIOTICS? There are some bacteria that reside in our gut which help carry out many of our gut functions and these are what we call “probiotics”. You can think of them as “good bacteria” that’s helping you maintain good balance in your body! 3 WAYS PROBIOTICS ARE HELPFUL TO YOUR CHILD’S HEALTH Probiotics have a lot of benefits to the health of your child. Let us look at 3 major benefits of probiotics: Probiotics help balance the good bacteria in your child’s digestive system Probiotics can boost your child’s immune system It may reduce the severity of certain allergies and eczema PROBIOTICS IS SUITABLE FOR: Preventing and treating diarrhoea/ constipation Traveling: Prevent travellers’ diarrhoea (prophylaxis) Children who don't take enough fibre Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea Taking antibiotics can cause gut imbalance, which can lead to diarrhoea, especially in children. Numerous studies have shown that taking probiotics at the same time as antibiotics can reduce the risk of diarrhoea by more than 50%. However, it is important to take antibiotics and probiotics a few hours apart, to prevent the probiotics from being killed by antibiotics if taken together. Probiotics can also be taken after a course of antibiotics to restore some of the healthy bacteria in the intestines. THE TOP 5 PROBIOTIC BRANDS PARENTS ARE BUYING We recommend parents to only buy probiotics from reputable stores. Also, obvious as it may seem, do review storage requirements of the probiotics brand, and to always remember to check the expiry dates before purchase. Excess heat can degrade the viability of probiotics. Over here at Glovida, we store all our products in 24-hour airconditioned warehouse environment. This helps to ensure the best quality control for all your probiotics.

Imagine having to deal with an uncontrollable itch in the middle of an important meeting, having uninvited stares on the visible red, rough patches, or scars (from scratching the itch!) on your body; and sometimes, losing sleep as the itch gets so bad in the middle of the night that it causes you much discomfort; all these can be terribly stressful and that doesn’t help with the eczema situation at all! We’ve had many customers reach out to us for issues on eczema and sensitive skin for themselves and their children. So here, we’ve put together a list of the recommended brands by our in-house pharmacist to help alleviate the skin’s sensitivity and eczema-related discomfort effectively: 1. Ceradan Ceradan is a brand highly recommended by many dermatologists. Perfectly formulated to treat eczema-prone skin, Ceradan Skin Barrier Repair Cream strengthens the skin's protective barrier by replenishing the ceramide often lacking in dry, sensitive skin. On the other hand, Ceradan Hydra Cream prolongs the flare-free period effectively by hydrating your skin to the fullest to soothe the itch of eczema. These products can be used without any restrictions on any skin surfaces and are suitable even for newborns! 2. ISODERM A top favorite among skin specialists, Isoderm Liquid Soap-Free Cleanser has restorative properties that leave one’s skin soft and supple. This moisturizing cleanser regulates your skin’s acidic protective barrier to an optimal level that prevents skin irritation. Apart from shielding your skin against environmental irritants and bacterial infections, it also gives your skin long-lasting hydration! With its hypoallergenic and non-alkaline properties, Isoderm Baby Liquid Cleanser is a perfect option for babies and young kids, too. 3. SUU BALM Developed at the National Skin Centre in Singapore, Suu Balm Soothing Moisturizer provides the perfect care for tender eczema prone skin. Formulated to complement our country’s humid climate, it’s a light, non-sticky moisturizer that contains menthol - an ingredient that cools the skin. Coupled with the powerful moisture-retaining capacity of ceramides, it helps to provide rapid relief from itch. Suu Balm Kids Head To Toe Wash is also ideal for gentle cleansing on sensitive, dry skin. It leaves skin feeling soothed, moisturised, and refreshed after a shower! The absence of parabens, preservatives, and artificial fragrances make these products suitable for all skin types. 4. GLOVES IN A BOTTLE Gloves in a Bottle Shielding Lotion seeks to revolutionise and surpass normal lotions by locking-in the skin’s natural oil and moisture balance. Specifically formulated for skin conditions like dry skin, sensitive skin and eczema, the “invisible gloves” or protective barriers strengthen the outer layer of the skin cells to safeguard it from moisture-sucking irritants or triggers from the environment. 5. Y-NOT NATURAL A winner of Beauty Insider’s Best Organic/Natural Products for 2018, the Y-Not Natural Australian Emu Oil is an all-natural, non-toxic, and hypo-allergenic penetrating oil that reduces the inflammation caused by eczema. Pure emu oil has been long proven to protect skin from harsh elements. It includes anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, pain relief and anti-oxidant (anti ageing) properties that are beneficial for the skin. It can also penetrate and moisturize deeper than any other oils in the market today as it is able to mirror our skin's natural lipids! Priding itself as being the most-used natural therapy oil, it has a skin cell regenerator agent that keeps the skin from scarring and heals it after blowbacks from skin treatments. It’s definitely a must-have product that improves eczema, promote healing of wounds, cuts and burns effectively! 6. VASSE VIRGIN Vasse Virgin, an Australian brand, was established to produce high quality natural skincare products that target dry-skin conditions like eczema. To rejuvenate and maintain healthy skin, virgin olive oil is a key ingredient that can be found in all of its products. Not only does the oil intensely hydrates your skin, it also aids in skin repair and renewal. The brand's Chamomile & Lavender Olive Body Lotion serves as a nourishing lotion that is perfect for stressed or dry skin. The extra virgin olive oil plus the calming properties of lavender scent leaves your skin hydrated and refreshed with every application. Perfect for sensitive skin types, Vasse Virgin Kids Soothing Balm soothes dry, irritated skin, and aids in the calming of bites, stings, or stressed skin. 7. SUKIN Sukin Botanical Body Wash contains the skin-softening properties of jojoba and avocado that hydrate and purify even the most sensitive skin types. Not only is this product free from sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), it is also backed by the aromatic properties of rose hip, tangerine, mandarin, lavender oils, and vanilla extract to keep your skin nourished and moisturised from day to night.

Works well to prevent hyperpigmentation from UV rays. Recommended to take for internal protection together with regular application of sunblock Genevieve Gay 2022-07-18 One stop shop! I’ve used this product before and it works well! Was travelling during summer and my sensitive skin needed extra protection. Time starved, Glovida makes it easy to order online and delivery is swift! Product is legit and saves me the hassle of running to my aesthetic doctor. A life saver. J . 2021-12-11 See a difference Has been using this product for a while. Really brightens and whiten the overall skin Sage Lee 2021-06-11 recommended by my aesthetics doctor been taking it for years. along with the oral ultra for sun protection. All recommended by my aesthetics doctor. FRANS PRANATA 2021-06-09 Hassle free Glovida makes it hassle free for clinic exclusives items during this pandemic time. I could not even understand why these supplements are clinics' only. It's not that strong of a medicine either. To avoid counterfeit? With online nowadays could just appoint official online partners. As for the quality of the product, let' the stars speak by itself. Thanks Glovida for making it hassle free Mary S L 2021-06-07 been a long time user better pricing and quick delivery here. 100% recommend Yonit Tan 2020-09-03 Super worth it! I usually buy this from clinic and it's a little more expensive. Also, have to queue and sometimes gotta go for consultation first. However, having this product in glovida has been nothing short of AWESOME! So convenient. :-) Thanks Glo! This product has done wonders and honestly i feel its better than CxxxxxxTomato. price wise already win. and it works very well for me also. good product to buy if you are looking to whiten! Tricia 2020-03-06 Great product! Cheaper than retail and fast delivery! Makes my face fairer and more radiant AT 2019-11-04 Thank you Glovida! Am glad that Glovida has managed to bring in items that are exclusive to clinics. This has brought us many conveniences and a cost-saving alternative. Helio Radiance Max works faster and I gained many compliments. I stopped for about half a year because it is costly and troublesome to visit selected clinics just to purchase supplements. Furthermore, some clinics will push me to buy 3 bottles at one go, just to receive a 5% discount. I am back n this supplement now because of Glovida. Thank you! #this is not a sponsored post, and I do not work for them - directly or indirectly. This is my very rare product review posted ever posted as I am grateful for the money saved buying from here. One true advice: Take with oral sunblock to enhance performance. Also, if you are travelling to the beach, consume oral sunblock ULTRA. You will be amazed that we do not get tanned so easily. Grace 2019-09-01 Cheaper alternatives to Crystal Tomato supplements After consuming Heliocare max 240 for a month, I can notice a healthy glow on my face and the PIH from the occasional acnes and pimples have almost cleared up. It is also cost effective as compared to Crystal Tomato supplements. Doublegrace 2019-08-26 Excellent Am excited about trying this products, thanks for the reviews of heliocare max YS 2019-07-27 My go-to skin supplement The harsh sunlight and tropical weather in Singapore is unforgiving, and it has caused hyperpigmentation and age spots on my face. After taking this for a month, i’ve noticed that my skin has gotten fairer, and pigment spots have gotten lighter. Skin has gotten smoother as well. Take it with the oral sunblock for enhanced effect. MeLz 2018-02-25 Love this This is really great for me as it's easy to use, and there is no need to worry about slathering on too many creams or lotions! It's really helped with my freckles. eve 2018-01-30 Great Product Started taking Heliocare white radiance in Dec'17. One of my black spot reduced size in half. Just ordered the Max 240. Skin is considerable fairer, take it with the oral sunblock for greater effect. Grace 2017-07-10 I love the range of clinic-exclusive products you have Very good pricing and prompt service and replies. Will be back to support again. Alex 2017-06-26 Works Well This product works as advertised - my dermatologist diagnosed me with skin sensitivity to sunlight (I get a rash if exposed for too long), and recommended this product; I don't get a rash when I take it consistently for prevention. CoCo 2017-06-26 2 months in, a noticeable improvement Have been using for 2 months. It works! At 1 capsule a day my melasma and brown spots are not getting darker and looks like its lightening slightly. I started noticing an improvement. As has been mentioned, you do need to keep using a good sunscreen. Since it takes 3 months for skin cells to turn over, I will continue to use for an additional month to get a better idea of how well it works and what maximum improvement I can expect. Some research indicates the fernleaf extract is also good for your immune system. It seems to be helping in this way as well. I have tried many other melasma treatments including hydroquinone 10 %, This works as well if not better without skin thinning side effects. MH Wong 2017-06-08 This really works I have been pleasantly surprised by the results of Heliocare Pure White Max. Overall, my skin looks clearer, more radiant and not just on my face, but overall body skin condition has improved. Great pricing here too. and very fast delivery.

GC Tooth Mousse is a delicious tasting, water based, sugar free crème that is beneficial for teeth. It contains calcium and phosphate; the major minerals teeth are made from. Because calcium and phosphate are carried in a special milk-derived protein called Recaldent (CPP-ACP), they are available in a soluble form. This means GC Tooth Mousse provides extra protection for teeth, buffers dental plaque acid from bacteria in the mouth and also protects teeth from acidic foods and drinks. GC Tooth Mousse, the first product for professional use to contain this complex of CPP-ACP (Recaldent), is the ideal delivery system for bio-available calcium and phosphate ions. Tooth Mousse is not toothpaste. It is made of milk products so swallowing the product is safe and it can be used throughout the day. However, because Tooth Mousse is derived from milk protein (casein) it is not suitable for people who have a suspected or proven allergy to milk proteins. Natural defence against caries with for people who: • have a low to medium risk of caries • suffer from white spot lesions • experience hypersensitivity before and after teeth whitening • have had professional procedures such as root scaling or cleaning • for children below the age of six BENEFITS: • It contains CPP-ACP a revolutionary new ingredient that helps to repair and restore tooth enamel. • Tooth Mousse provides relief for sensitive teeth. • Regular use will help protect teeth from decay and make them stronger. • It is sugar and lactose free. • Helps prevent white spots during and after orthodontic brackets. FLAVOUR: Tutti-Frutti Made in USA INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Apply to teeth using a clean finger, or cotton tip swab or custom bleaching tray. 2) Leave the Tooth Mousse undisturbed for three minutes in the first instance. 3) Then spread the Tooth Mousse around the mouth with the tongue and hold for a further one or two minutes. 4) Do not to eat or drink for 30 minutes following application.

Fast delivery and good price, especially during promotions. Improves children’s immunity and gut health. Isabel Tan 2022-01-26 Build immunity Multiple purchases from Glovida as it’s cheaper with promo compared to outside. Love that it helps to build immunity and protects my kids gut health Alicia Tan 2021-11-13 Great Value & Speedy Delivery Ordered this during the 11.11 sale and got a good deal for this. Best part was that the order was delivered the next day. Calise 2018-02-24 Protects gut health Lactogg protects the gut health of my children esp when they are down with stomach flu and could not stomach anything. I bought a dozen at one go during 12.12 sale. My children are taking one per day. Builds up their immunity. Glovida never fails to call to arrange delivery time slot. Prompt and responsible! Lin 2017-11-10 Better deal Consider to be more expensive than other probiotics and managed to get from Glovida at a cheaper price. Got it for my baby for eczema (recommended by pd) and hopes in long run, it will improves his condition. Fiona 2017-11-09 Thumbs up! Good product especially in helping bowel movements for my toddler! Louisa 2017-08-20 Pricier than other probiotics This product is generally pricier than other probiotics I've tried. But it's like this across other places, and Glovida happens to sell them cheaper than pharmacies. I don't know if this probiotic is the best for me, but so far based on what I have tried, this one seems to work well for me, and I have noticed less occurrences of gastric pains when on this. The downside is that this probiotic needs to be refrigerated, so I tend to forget to take it as regularly as I hope to. I still hope price for this will go down across the board! Jan 2017-08-17 Excellent Product, Price & Personal Service! I have ordered this product from Glovida twice, because of its excellent service. The staff is kind and extremely efficient. The product is a must-have for young kids and prevents most stomach discomforts. The price is good especially when there are promotions such as Mother's Day or Anniversary Promotions! Highly recommended! Rosalind 2017-08-16 Happy with it Fast delivery. Maybe can put expire date on the website. Rosalind 2017-08-16 Happy with it Fast delivery. Maybe can put expire date on the website. Michelle 2017-07-16 Best quality probiotics out there Because of our busy schedule we hardly have time to make our own fermented products such as kefir. So our next best alternative is to source for a top quality probiotics to improve our gut health. Our family lives by this brand and have felt a difference to our bowel movements, and immunity. Lynda 2017-07-10 Very impressive service I was very impressed by the prompt service Glovida gave. The probiotics really arrived the very next day and the courier service came with a cooler bag.

I appreciate it greatly! :) J 2017-03-13 Still undecided if it's helping with my eczema. P.S. Great after sales service I've been on lactogg for about 3 months or so now. Need more time to tell if it's benefitting me. Will continue to take it for a few more months. p.s. I ordered a box of lactogg but received another brand's probiotic capsules. I emailed Glovida; they replied shortly after. They were apologetic and said that they'd self-deliver the correct item to me later that day. Rather fast delivery, great customer service. Sabrina Tan 2017-03-13 I will definitely order again! It was a breeze ordering. The online chat was also easy to use. Delivery was very fast and good.

Hylo-Comod contains the sodium salt of hyaluronic acid, a natural substance that is found in the eye but also in other parts of the body. Due to its special physical property, it forms a regular, stable. long lasting lubricating moisture film on the ocular surface that is not easily rinsed off. It does, however, not cause blurred vision and protects the eyes from dryness and irritation for a long time. This is particularly important if the user wears contact lenses, because the contact lens needs to swim in sufficient tear fluid in order not to cause any discomfort. Hylo-Comod may be used while wearing contact lenses. Wearing soft or hard contact lenses will be made more comfortable by using Hylo-Comod as it does not form crusts or deposits. As Hylo-Comod is preservative-free, it is usually very well-tolerated. Additionally, Hylo-Comod is free of phosphates so that complications like deposits in the cornea are avoided. Hylo-Comod has a 6 MONTHS Shelf Life upon opening. Each bottle of 10ml is sufficient for about 300 drops. Made in Germany DIRECTIONS: Hylo-Comod should be used according to the instructions given by doctor or contact lens specialist. Generally, instill 1 drop of Hylo-Comod 3 times a day into each eye. If necessary, it can also be used more frequently. EXPIRY DATE: 30-Nov-2024 Rating & Reviews 0 /5 0 Ratings Love our product?

Flo Baby Saline offers advanced technology to deliver a sterile, preservative-free, non-medicated, non-sting nasal saline for babies and toddlers. Suitable for daily use. Using Flo Baby can help relieve a baby’s nasal symptoms due to COLDS and ALLERGIES because it can: • Wash away mucus including excessive mucus produced by colds, pollens, dust and other allergy-causing particles. • Help remove mucus plugs in the nose. • Moisturise nasal tissues. • Help prevent scabbing in the nose. Flo Baby has been designed with parents and carers in mind to! It is really easy and quick and only takes a few seconds to use – very useful when it comes to wriggly newborns and fidgety toddlers! Parents rate Flo Baby because it can be used at any angle repetitively (without the need for priming with each dose). Look for SPRAYS AT ANY ANGLE clearly marked on Flo Baby packaging. Baby sleep, feeding and settling tip: If your baby has a blocked, runny or snuffly nose, try Flo Baby 10 minutes BEFORE feeding, play and sleep time. This helps thin and clear mucus to enable easier breathing. Easier breathing means your baby may sleep and feed easier too! Made in Germany DIRECTIONS: 1) Position baby comfortably in their most comfortable position. 2) Position Flo Baby Saline applicator tip just below baby's nostril and insert the required dose into each nostril. 3) Wipe baby's nose with a soft clean tissue. DOSAGE: Newborn to 1 year: 1 spray per nostril. Over 12 months: 1-2 sprays per nostril. If congestion persists, please see your health care practitioner.

Isabel Tan 2022-01-26 Build immunity Multiple purchases from Glovida as it’s cheaper with promo compared to outside. Love that it helps to build immunity and protects my kids gut health Alicia Tan 2021-11-13 Great Value & Speedy Delivery Ordered this during the 11.11 sale and got a good deal for this. Best part was that the order was delivered the next day. Calise 2018-02-24 Protects gut health Lactogg protects the gut health of my children esp when they are down with stomach flu and could not stomach anything. I bought a dozen at one go during 12.12 sale. My children are taking one per day. Builds up their immunity. Glovida never fails to call to arrange delivery time slot. Prompt and responsible! Lin 2017-11-10 Better deal Consider to be more expensive than other probiotics and managed to get from Glovida at a cheaper price. Got it for my baby for eczema (recommended by pd) and hopes in long run, it will improves his condition. Fiona 2017-11-09 Thumbs up! Good product especially in helping bowel movements for my toddler! Louisa 2017-08-20 Pricier than other probiotics This product is generally pricier than other probiotics I've tried. But it's like this across other places, and Glovida happens to sell them cheaper than pharmacies. I don't know if this probiotic is the best for me, but so far based on what I have tried, this one seems to work well for me, and I have noticed less occurrences of gastric pains when on this. The downside is that this probiotic needs to be refrigerated, so I tend to forget to take it as regularly as I hope to. I still hope price for this will go down across the board! Jan 2017-08-17 Excellent Product, Price & Personal Service! I have ordered this product from Glovida twice, because of its excellent service. The staff is kind and extremely efficient. The product is a must-have for young kids and prevents most stomach discomforts. The price is good especially when there are promotions such as Mother's Day or Anniversary Promotions! Highly recommended! Rosalind 2017-08-16 Happy with it Fast delivery. Maybe can put expire date on the website. Rosalind 2017-08-16 Happy with it Fast delivery. Maybe can put expire date on the website. Michelle 2017-07-16 Best quality probiotics out there Because of our busy schedule we hardly have time to make our own fermented products such as kefir. So our next best alternative is to source for a top quality probiotics to improve our gut health. Our family lives by this brand and have felt a difference to our bowel movements, and immunity. Lynda 2017-07-10 Very impressive service I was very impressed by the prompt service Glovida gave. The probiotics really arrived the very next day and the courier service came with a cooler bag.

I appreciate it greatly! :) J 2017-03-13 Still undecided if it's helping with my eczema. P.S. Great after sales service I've been on lactogg for about 3 months or so now. Need more time to tell if it's benefitting me. Will continue to take it for a few more months. p.s. I ordered a box of lactogg but received another brand's probiotic capsules. I emailed Glovida; they replied shortly after. They were apologetic and said that they'd self-deliver the correct item to me later that day. Rather fast delivery, great customer service. Sabrina Tan 2017-03-13 I will definitely order again! It was a breeze ordering. The online chat was also easy to use. Delivery was very fast and good.

Introduction A high fever can be a concerning symptom for parents, especially when it comes to their children. It does not help if the high fever is also discovered at a time where all nearby medical clinics are closed. However, before you decide to seek emergency medical attention at the nearest hospital, it is important to evaluate if you need to make a trip to the A&E, or if your child can be self-treated at home first. In this article, we will discuss the symptoms to look for, over-the-counter remedies, and when to seek emergency medical attention for a child with a high fever. 2. Symptoms to Look For A fever is defined as a body temperature of 38°C or higher. By itself, it is usually not a cause for concern as it is the body's natural response against an infection. Children with high fever tend to be less energetic and more irritable. They may sleep more than usual to recover from the underlying illness. It is also normal for them to have a reduced appetite for solid food and to drink less. They may also experience shivers as their body temperature rises. It is important to note that a higher grade fever also does not mean that your child has a more severe illness. Similarly, a low-grade fever does not necessarily mean that the illness is minor. Hence, it is more important to monitor if the child is experiencing other symptoms that may indicate an underlying infection or other serious conditions that require prompt medical attention. Some of the warning signs that your child may need emergency medical attention include: Fever that reaches a temperature of 41.0°C (or 38.0°C for children less than 3 months old) Having difficulty breathing Having severe headache and/or neck stiffness or pain Having less than usual fluid intake and/or urine output Experiencing greater difficulty in awakening from sleep Interacting with you lesser than usual Feeling confused and disoriented Feeding poorly and vomiting Seizures or fits Developing new symptoms like abdominal pain or rash / purple spots If your child's fever is accompanied by any of the warning signs listed above, it may indicate a serious condition and you should seek emergency medical attention at a hospital's A&E department. If your child's condition is stable and they are not experiencing any of the warning signs, you can try to reduce the fever with over-the-counter medications and keep them hydrated, and see a doctor during clinic hours if the fever persists for more than 72 hours (or 24 hours for children less than 2 years old). When in doubt, parents or caregivers should contact the child's healthcare provider to get further advice on the available treatment options. 3.            Over-the-Counter Medications for your Child If your child's condition is stable and they are not experiencing any of the warning signs mentioned above, you can try to reduce the fever with over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. These medications can typically help to lower your child's body temperature by 1 - 2°C and relieve any discomfort they may be experiencing. Do note that you will also need to know exactly how much medication to give your baby/child, which may be based on his/her weight and not age. To be safe, parents should consult a doctor or pharmacist to check the correct dosage, especially if the child’s weight has significantly changed since the last visit to the doctor. For the first line of treatment, paracetamol can be used every 4 hours (if the temperature is above 38.5°C) to 6 hours (if the temperature is below 38.5°C). Do not use paracetamol in infants less than 3 months old. Ibuprofen can be given every 6 hours if the temperature is persistently above 38.5°C, 1 to 2 hours after giving paracetamol.  Do not use ibuprofen in infants less than 6 months old. For infants between 6 months and less than 1 year old, ibuprofen can be given every 8 hours. 4.            Other Measures to Consider It is also important to keep your child hydrated by offering plenty of fluids, such as water, ice pops, or clear fruit juices. You should also dress your child in light clothing to allow heat exchange and keep the room cool and well ventilated. Check the temperature of your child every 4 hours in the day to monitor the condition. It is not advisable to use ice/cold water to bring a high fever down as it may cause chills or shivering, further raising the baby’s temperature. Instead, use tap or lukewarm water and apply a cool compress to the forehead, nape of neck, armpits, neck and groin area, for no more than 30 minutes at one time. If your child starts to shiver, stop the sponging. 5.            Recommended Products To Bring Down The Fever Sambucol Black Elderberry Cold & Flu Relief Kids Liquid 120ml Children love the taste of Sambucol Black Elderberry Cold & Flu Relief Kids Liquid!

Stocking up on over-the-counter remedies such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, together with proper hydration can help to reduce the fever and relieve any discomfort for non-emergency cases. That being said, it is essential to seek medical attention if your child is experiencing any of the warning signs, such as difficulty breathing, severe headache, neck pain, lethargy, seizures, or a rash. By being aware of the symptoms and seeking the appropriate medical attention, you can ensure that your child receives the right care they need to recover from their high fever.

It is the most powerful endogenous anti-oxidant. Glutathione protects the body from oxidative stress, inflammation and toxins, thereby improving the body’s functional status. Oxidative stress causes damage to cellular macromolecules resulting in physiological aging and the degenerative processes that occur in age-related diseases. Glutathione supplementation helps to delay the aging and degenerative processes, thereby keeping the body healthy and youthful. Many studies have shown Glutathione superior benefit in lightening and brightening complexions while simultaneously retarding free radical damage. It thus keeps skin youthful, supple and fair. The innovative sublingual Oxithion Sublingual Tablets is formulated as fast dissolving sublingual tablets, with an innovative patented technology. L-Glutathione is thus rapidly absorbed through the mouth mucosa into the body without being metabolized and then inactivated by the liver. The sublingual absorption also ensures a series of important benefits to the effectiveness of the product: ease of administration even in people with difficulties in swallowing; high tolerability; increased bioavailability of the active ingredients. BENEFITS: • Brightening for a radiant and luminous complexion • Prevention or reduction of age-related or photo-induced dark spots on the skin • Lightening of skin tone on the face and body • Provides antioxidant protection against skin aging   Made in Italy DIRECTIONS: How to Use: Place one tablet under the tongue and allow to dissolve before swallowing.Recommended Daily Dose: 1-2 tablets daily, preferably between meals.

This potent formula hydrates, visibly strengthens, firms and improves skin’s defense against irritation and damage. Oil-free, Fragrance-free, silicone-free KEY INGREDIENTS: • ANTARCTICINE: Antarcticine is a rare ingredient derived from glaciers in Antarctica. It is known for its anti-ageing and collagen regeneration properties. Antarcticine provides the appearance of youthful skin by smoothing fine lines and wrinkles. Skin is instantly moisturized and fine lines are diminished. • SNOW FUNGUS: Snow fungus have similar hydration properties as Hyaluronic acid with its molecules being smaller than that of Hyaluronic acid. This allows the magic ingredient to penetrate deeper into the skin. Snow fungus also inhibit melanin production which fosters to brighten up the skin. • VELVET HORN: Velvet horn is also known as Codium Tomentosum which is a type of Marine Algae. It instantly provides deep levels of moisture for a prolonged period on the skin. Not only does it provide intensive hydration on the skin, it also plumps up the skin for a healthier glowing skin effect. • NIACINAMIDE & VITAMIN B5: Niacinamide inhibits the transfer of melanin to the skin surface, preventing the formation of sunspots and freckles. Niacinamide also reduces the appearance of pores, balances oil production and strengthens the skin barrier. Vitamin B5 eliminates the sticky residue left by conventional serums, leaving skin skin soft and moisturised. Made in Taiwan HOW TO USE: After cleansing and toning, dispense 1-2 drops of Deep Sea Glow Serum and gently pat onto slightly damp face and neck until fully absorbed. Follow with moisturizer to seal everything in place. Apply daily, AM and PM. Keep in a cool, dry place--away from direct light.

Germaine 2017-07-04 This rescued me from the crazy hair loss I had post pregnancy!! I was extremely distressed post-pregnancy as my hair kept falling off in clumps. Pretty depressing to pick up so much hair at the shower, and in the bedroom where i blow dry my hair. Was introduced to Aveda Invati by my hair stylist and truly, my hair loss was reduced to a minimal after use. It helps to have this here at Glovida at a better pricing, given that this shampoo isn't cheap! Great service and packaging by the way. Vicki 2017-06-26 Great Product The package came through perfect, timely and the product really makes a big difference with my hair. Ernest 2017-06-26 Wow..... Great product, Love it Wow.....

Eight different stains of bacteria were selected, grown in specific culture media and then mixed in proportion to optimize the effects. Liquid suspension works particularly well with small children who are incapable of swallowing capsules. A popular method to manage the problem is opening the capsules and dissolving the content in water or juice; however, that is not a good way because the manufacturer of the product might not have prepared the product for such a form of administration, which can limit its activity. Vivomixx Probiotics Drop does not contain gluten, soy, preservatives and synthetic sweeteners. It may contain traces of milk. 0.5 ml correspond to 5 billion live lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria & 400 IU Vitamin D Content: 1 bottle of 10 ml with a 1500mg sachet and 1 graduated dispenser BENEFITS: • Defends against diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, and irritable bowel syndrome • Protects against a number of gut-related issues • Vitamin D3 for support immune system, bone health and muscle strength. • 1 bottle contains 10 ml, equivalent to 100 drops. Made in Italy DOSAGE: Recommended dosage: 0.5-1 ml per day, corresponding to 5-10 billion bacteria and 400-800 IU of Vitamin D. The product can be mixed with water and non-carbonated drinks or other cold liquids. For infants, Vivomixx drop can be added to formula milk. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Screw the bottle cap in anti-clockwise direction to break the seal. Tear open the sachet containing the probiotic powder. Empty the sachet contents into the bottle. Shake vigorously to obtain a uniform suspension. Remove the bottle cap and place the graduated dispenser. Always shake before every use. Once reconstituted, it must be kept refrigerated and used within 3 weeks. CARE & STORAGE: Vivomixx products are refrigerated in our warehouse at all times. Vivomixx contains live bacteria which are sensitive to heat, it is therefore recommended to keep the product refrigerated. However it may be stored at room temperature for UP TO ONE WEEK without the quality of the probiotics being compromised. Packing and delivering of probiotics are done on the very same day. We do not accept exchanges or returns after products are delivered. EXPIRY DATE: 31-Jul-2024 Rating & Reviews 5 /5 7 Ratings Love our product?

I wanted vivomixx for them because most doctors recommend it but it’s such a hassle to get it from hospitals or stores. Glovida is great in terms of pricing, customer relations and product assurance! I work in Japan at the moment and I’m so glad that I can order probiotics on behalf of my parents hassle free through glovida!

It help me to reduce gastric problem. Huey 2018-11-16 Superb Product is effective and Glovida service is superb. I just purchased half an hour ago and i got msg from the delivery guy - to say that they will deliver it by today...Woah! Cold pack will be included for the probiotics - maintain the viability. Victor 2018-03-11 Highly Effective Probiotic Product. Much Better Than Any Yogurt, Yakult and Vitagen A truly effective probiotic product that contains much higher levels of good bacteria when compared to any yogurt or probiotic drinks like Yakult or Vitagen. Also does not contain additional sugar content, which helps reduce risk of diabetes. Everyone's immune system is within his very own digestive system. So, when you want to keep your body healthy, in addition to healthy eating and exercise habits, you have to keep your digestive system healthy as well by making sure the levels of good bacteria (which is not naturally produced in our bodies) in your gut is maintained daily. Ever since taking Vivomixx, my digestion and bowel movement has greatly improved, and I am truly thankful that this has also helped me stay healthy, especially during the recent flu season a few months ago. A good sign that my immune system has strengthened as well. Calise 2018-02-24 Fantastic product A colleague recommended vivomixx to me as it helped her with her gastro problems. I have been taking one per day for 2 months now and it really makes a difference! No more constipation and moving bowels is a breeze! I no longer feel bloated after meals. I will be back for more. Glovida keeps their probiotics well chilled and ensures they deliver it that way too. Thumbs up! VL 2018-01-15 Good Product Good Product. Helps keep my digestive system working properly. Jeslyn 2017-09-06 GREAT PRODUCT Tried this product after reading the reviews. Been suffering from constipation since young and occasionally indigestion.

Was quite skeptical when I was introduced to this product by a pharmacist.. tried it since April this year..  Bloatedness much reduced & most of the time, don't give too much of problem whenever I take it. But Once I stop, it's back to normal. Guess lifestyle & diet plays a part too. -Will Continue taking to maintain my gut health.. Price also lower than those at retail store (if no promotion going on.) Happy to discover this product :) Sarah 2017-06-20 Great product  I had digestive issues after 2 rounds of antibiotics. Bloating, gas , tummy aches. But one capsule of this every morning took care of it. I no longer wake up to stomachaches, or uncomfortable gas after lunch, this has also normalized my bowel patterns. 5 stars. I will repurchase and take it for as long as I need to. Will definitely bring this overseas when I travel too. Thank God for this as it gave me great relief from all these uncomfortable stomach problems. 3 cheers! Jerry 2017-03-21 I'm impressed Impressed with the excellent service. My questions were answered promptly and goods were delivered the very next day. Glovida's team delivered it personally to ensure quality control. Keep up the good work! Jolyn 2017-01-17 Great product at a great price! Much cheaper at Glovida especially when there's no promotion at retail stores. Great delivery service too. Small ice pack included to ensure the product is kept at the right temperature. wan 2017-01-14 Very effective product I have been taking vivomaxx since mid 2015. It was known as vs#3 then. I think it helps intestinal problem like bowel disorder or ibs-like problems. Was recommended by my gastroenterologist. Glovida not only sells vivomaxx cheaper than other pharmacies, it provides very good service. The probiotics which contain live bacteria was personally couriered to ensure its quality not compromised. I would definitely buy from Glovida again. gordon 2017-01-09 quick and reliable my supply ran low and I didn't have time to go to my regular pharmacy to buy. did a google search and glovida came out. decided to try and was pleasantly surprised at the swift delivery.

Looks like we ran out of this product. Do register to get notified once we've stocked up! Notify Me Product Details Description Remescar assists in the healing process of both new and old scars resulting from surgery, burns, bug bites, acne, stretch marks, etc., by releasing a thin and discrete silicone-based film to provide a suitable healing micro-environment for the scar while maintaining the skin’s natural moisture balance. It can also be used as a preventive therapy on closed wounds to reduce scarring or for post laser treatment and helps to relieve the burning and itching of the scarred tissue. Beta-glucan has strong, calming, protective and hydrating properties. It's an excellent film former. The combination of β-glucan with polymeric film formers such as PVP (Polyvinyl pyrrolidone) and PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) help to accelerate the wound healing process. Besides the film formation, which is the first and most important action of Remescar, it also contains strong UV filters. It is widely known that scars need to be protected from UV radiation. That is why this scar stick incorporates powerful UV-A and UV-B filters. BENEFITS: • For old and new scars • Smoothes, softens and helps to reduce scar tissue • Easy to use stick applicator • For all areas of the face and body • Use twice a day for 2 to 3 months • Invisible upon application Made in Belgium USAGE: Ensure the scarred are is closed, clean and dry.

Cheaper than everywhere and fast delivery. SS Tan 2021-06-30 Gentleness you can feel immediately! Have been looking around for a gentle cleanser that does not dry up the skin... and fell in love with this immediately. Nice scent and so gentle on the skin.... can feel the effects almost immediately! Huey Huey 2021-06-14 Love Isoderm My husband has very sensitive skin - was grateful to friend who has recommended us Isoderm. He has no complain since then :) Geraldine Lim 2021-06-05 My family and I have been using Isoderm for years! I have tried all kinds of cleansers. Most are just too drying in the long run..and those that are for sensitive skin are too mild and do not form a lather (so there's always this feeling like you havent quite finished bathing:P) Isoderm lathers well, is not drying and it is suitable for sensitive, eczema-prone skin (like my daughter's) and really keeps the skin moisture locked in. Never felt the need to change cleansers since we started Isoderm. Denise Tay 2021-02-04 Good buy Delivered promptly in good conditions. Good product for dry skin. Jelin 2020-07-28 Isoderm is gentle and healing Was recommended to Isoderm by my doctor as a face wash 4 years ago. Subsequently use it as a body wash too as was thinking since it is so gentle even for the face, why not on body. It helps soothe my urticaria, keeping my skin moist yet smooth feel. Since then I recommended isoderm to a few friends who have eczema issues and it helps soothe the problem too. Poppy 2017-10-30 Best liquid cleanser for eczema skin My son has had eczema since he was little and it has got worse through the years with his track and field and football. He's 18 and at the moment, he's just managing the condition as he just can't give up his sports. One doctor recommended Isoderm about 2 years ago and he's been using this since. Having tried so many products, he feels this liquid cleanser works best for him and it's most soothing. The only drawback - it's $25 for a 500ml bottle at the pharmacies! So, when I managed to get this at $17 per bottle at Glovida, I jumped on it. I'm just glad I found Glovida and the best part, I get the items in a matter of 2 days or so. So, why not! Esther 2017-08-21 Gentle for my sensitive skin I love how this product is able to use for both face and body. It's really convenient for me to use the same product without the need to stock up 2 products for different usage. It also cleanses effectively and I can use it at ease without worrying allergic reaction Esther 2017-07-04 Best cleanser ever This is by far the best cleanser. Am glad to have found it here. We stock up on this at home and thus, the savings with orders of 3 or more works really well for us. pearlball 2017-05-08 Great! Was introduced to isoderm by my dermatologist 10 years ago. It was great, and I introduced to my family. It has hence become the favourite for us! Glad to find this website and enjoy amazing saving! Life is Good! 2017-02-01 My all-time favourite I was first introduced to this several years ago by my family doctor. Absolutely love it! My entire family uses this, and I am so glad to have found this here. Hard to find outside and the superb price here really helps in savings, especially for a family staple like this! Mr. K Chung 2016-12-19 my family uses this my family uses this. it's great. Lisa 2016-07-28 Isoderm is a great product.

Nasaval Cold & Flu is a natural nasal powder spray containing a blend of micronized cellulose, peppermint and wild garlic that delivers fast protection from airborne germs that are inhaled via the nose. By trapping, absorbing and neutralising air borne germs, Nasaval Cold & Flu stops the causes of infection rather than just treating the symptoms. Simply squeeze from the easy to use dispense bottle into each nostril will rapidly distribute fine powder throughout the upper nasal passages and sinuses and remain effective for several hours. This product is non- drowsy and does not have any known side effects which is suitable for children from 3 years, adults, pregnant and breast-feeding women. BENEFITS: • Shorten the duration and severity of cold and flu-like symptoms • Scientifically proven to block airborne allergens and germs • Starts to defend in 2 minutes • Natural ingredients without any antihistamines, steroids, drugs or medicines • Non- drowsy and without known side effects • Suitable for vegans Made in UK INGREDIENTS: HPMC 93%, Peppermint Powder 2%, European wild garlic powder 5% DIRECTIONS: Step 1: Blow your nose. Step 2: Remove cap and shake the bottle side to side. Step 3: Administer a test spray to gauge the pressure required for an ideal dose, which is a 10 to 15cm plume of powder. If you find the bottle too stiff to squeeze with one hand then use both hands (once you are used to taking Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker the test spray is no longer needed). Step 4: Place the nozzle of the bottle just inside the nose and apply 1 to 2 sprays into each nostril. Inhale gently while squeezing but do not inhale deeply. Step 5: Re-apply each time you blow your nose. Apply 2 to 3 times per day to maintain an effective barrier or if symtops have already started, use Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker 3 times per day until symtoms disappear. If used concurrently with other nasal spray, Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker should be re-applied afterwards to ensure that the barrier created is not disturbed. Do not use this product if you are sensitive to cellulose, mint or garlic. Not suitable for children under 3 years old EXPIRY DATE: 30-Sep-2025 Rating & Reviews 0 /5 0 Ratings Love our product?

You may just be able to find it at this online retailer The most effective beauty and wellness products are often the ones recommended by doctors and typically only stocked at clinics. Just think about the eczema-moisturisers that your family doctor advise you to get or the skin-brightening supplements that your dermatologist offers as a solution to hyperpigmentation. You’ve used these products and know that they work. But when it comes to replenishing them, you dread it. That’s because you probably need to secure an appointment at the clinic, go through a review with the doctor, and then purchase the products while paying for a consultation fee. We already feel the dreadful fuss just by typing the previous sentence. Here’s a life hack you probably don’t know yet: you can actually get clinic-exclusive products without seeing a doctor - if you know exactly where to look! Where to get clinic-exclusive products You may think that you need to get a prescription to purchase clinic-exclusive products such as eczema treatment cream and beauty supplements, guess what - you don’t! These products, while highly recommended by doctors, aren’t considered prescription medication, and are allowed to be bought off the shelves, even though they are commonly stocked at clinics because of how often medical professionals tell their patients to use them. But we’ve come across a gem that stocks clinic-exclusive products online. We’re talking about Glovida, an online health and beauty retailer that has been doing so for the last six years. Glovida may have only been set up in 2016, but it is supported by a parent company that is recognised as an expert in the pharmaceutical industry and has been in this business for almost 50 years. This is why Glovida understands the market and is able to bring in clinic-exclusive products that are 100% authentic. Thanks to its established relationship with many brand owners, Glovida is able to stock these products at affordable prices too. Supplements are also replenished regularly due to high demand so that you’d be sure that you’re getting the freshest stocks. In fact, the expiry dates are clearly indicated for all products listed, so you can have a peace of mind when you make a purchase. For those who still require an expert’s input, Glovida’s in-house pharmacists can provide advice over WhatsApp messages - super convenient! And if we can’t emphasise enough on convenience, Glovida also offers free next-day delivery; something that customers who are purchasing essentials urgently will really appreciate. Read on to see which popular products are available on it. Popular products to get on Glovida Ceradan Ceramide Skin Barrier Repair Cream Those who suffer from eczema-prone skin or extremely dry and flaky skin will be familiar with Ceradan’s line of products. The brand is often recommended by dermatologists to those who suffer from dry, itchy or sensitive skin because of its patented formula that features a unique ratio of ceramides, proven to improve eczema-prone skin. While Ceradan also carries body wash, diaper cream and even mosquito repellent cream, its Ceramide Skin Barrier Repair Cream is definitely its standout product. This gives relief to dry, sensitive, inflamed, and irritated skin with a compromised skin barrier, and it is also safe to be used on newborns, and on both body and face. Glovida stocks the Clinic Pack Size that you can usually only find in clinics. While its retail price is similar to what you can typically find in the market, it offers a special price of $66 each (instead of $68) if you purchase two units as a bundle - this is a steal that you can’t get anywhere else!

Scott’s Emulsion Original has 2 times better DHA absorption30* than non-emulsified free flowing cod liver oil. It contains nutrients that can help support your child’s brain development and healthy vision. Vitamin A and Vitamin D help support normal immune function and healthy growth as well as development. Calcium is beneficial for strong bones and teeth. What’s more, Scott’s Emulsion is pre-emulsified. This means the Cod Liver Oil in Scott’s Emulsion is broken down into tiny droplets that are evenly mixed through the formulation. These tiny emulsified droplets of oil are closer to the way our body naturally break down oils, so it helps make it easier for our body to digest the nutrients in Scott’s Emulsion. By giving your child Scott’s Emulsion Original daily, you can feel more confident that you are helping to support their healthy growth and development. * Based on results of iAUCO – 10h value for DHA at 1.96 times greater with Scott’s Emulsion Original vs a non-emulsified cod liver oil, in a pharmacokinetic study in 47 healthy adults, to determine and compare the plasma Omega 3 (DHA & EPA) levels after ingestion of Scott’s Emulsion Original and a non-emulsified fat.

Best Pain Relieving Supplements for Joint Pain Crippled by persistent pain or discomfort in your joints? Joint pain is more common than we think and could occur on areas like your shoulders, lower back, and especially the knees. The pain could be a dampener, especially if you are used to moving around and enjoy going on runs or long walks. Instead of resorting to expensive surgery or drastically reduce your physical activities; getting yourself good quality supplements for the joints or topical application could very likely be your next best bet. So, we have put together some of the best pain-relieving supplements and topical applications for your joint concerns: 1. Artrex DS 60’s for Maintenance of Healthy Joints & Cartilage Just because you don’t have arthritis, or haven’t been really plagued by joint pain yet, it doesn’t mean you can’t anticipate and combat the risk. More a prevention than a cure, Artrex DS 60’s is an all-natural, highly dependable and effective supplement used to maintain healthy joints and cartilage, as well as manage arthritic joint pains. Each tablet is formulated with natural ingredients like Winter Cherry (Withania somnifera), Indian Frankincense (Boswellia serrata), Turmeric (Curcuma longa), and Ginger (Zingiber officinale) that help to boost your joint health. Word of caution though; this brand sells like hotcakes on Glovida, so we suggest you stock up for future purposes! 2. Flexiseq Gel 50g Providing relief from osteoarthritis, the Flexiseq Gel 50G is applied directly on the affected joint. The gel uses the power of Sequessome Technology (Seq Tech) and penetrates deep into the affected cartilage, providing lubrication to the impaired joint and halts the incidence of osteoarthritis. Every application activates key lubricating ingredients that directly targets damaged joints so this soothing topical gel can ease the stiffness of your joints. The lubrication helps the joint’s cartilage restore its functions and improve the joint’s overall flexibility. What’s more is that many users see fast improvements in joint movement and flexibility with every application! 3.Omical 60’s Organic Milk Calcium Tablets We should all live by the maxim “prevention is better than cure”. For joint pain, you can take this motto to heart by trying Omical 60’s Organic Milk Calcium Tablets—milky tablets that provide strong calcium support! Omical is an all-natural milk-based tablet that contains 205mg of Elemental Calcium and added 200 IU of Vitamin D3 which helps the body absorb calcium better. It’s free from toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury and is a wholesome form of calcium, making it the best calcium choice for children and expectant mothers! To meet the daily recommended calcium intake, we suggest taking 2 Omical tablets daily. Help your bones and teeth effectively absorb calcium before joint pains hit you hard with these milk tablets! 4. Piascledine 300mg Capsules 30’s: Avocado and Soybean Oil for Improvement of Joint Function Good news to avocado lovers out there! Do you know that avocados serve as a good source of Vitamin E, a very effective micronutrient with anti-inflammatory effects? Avocado consumption is linked to a decreased risk of joint damage, especially during the early stages of osteoarthritis. That’s why Piascledine 300mg capsules is an absolute winner in joint care! Many have complimented this product for its efficacy and ability to reduce joint pain greatly! This effective supplementcontains the powerful blend of avocado and soybean oil that provides overall improvement of the joint function and improvement in mobility. 5. UC-II Standardized Cartilage 40mg Capsule 30’s (Type II Collagen) UC-II Standardized Cartilage 40mg is derived from chicken sternum cartilage and is responsible for retaining the cartilage’s tensile strength and toughness. UC-II ® is a patented form of collagen that complements the immune system in order to support healthy joints and take care of the cartilage. Human clinical studies have successfully established that a 40mg capsule of UC-II per day are linked to greater joint comfort and reduced joint tension! 6. Ultravite Boswellia & Ginger Complex 60’s Capping off this list is Ultravite’s Boswellia & Ginger Complex 60’s. This supplement has key herbs that not only support healthy joints, but also provide relief from body and muscle pains. Every capsule is formulated with the natural ingredients of Boswellia, winter cherry, ginger, and turmeric—perfect substances that trace years of effectivity and is backed by modern research. This is a perfect choice for anyone considering a natural alternative to relieving joint pain! The cartilage protecting the ends of our bones wears down and thins over time, that’s why it is inevitable to experience joint pain and osteoarthritis for many as we age. However, getting the right relief is attainable if you find the right supplements! Apart from maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit, be sure to get yourself some of our recommended pain-relieving, bone-strengthening supplements to boost your joint health and alleviate the aches!

The texture of the lipid balm is much smoother and easier to spread than the AI cream version. Found it to be much more effective for eczema than the AI cream too. Andrea 2018-03-19 Good for babies with eczema or very dry skin My 1-yr old has occasional outbreak of very dry skin in some areas. I have tried many products but none work as well as this. Have been using this since she was 4mths old. Very expensive though. Celine 2018-01-14 Good I got this product for my Niece as she was prescribed with this cream by the doctor due to her dry and irritated skin. It work really well on the baby’s skin if they are suffering from eczema. I had the same problem on my face recently due to the dry weather. Applied the night before and felt better and moisturised the next morning. It is pricey for just 50ml but the effect it gives definitely worth buying. Reamy 2017-09-12 No to Thirsty skin! Traveling is what I love most, and this Physiogel calming relief restoring lipid balm is one of the must haves in my travel kit. It helps my skin moisturized during long hauled flights and winter season as well. it's non-sticky, non greasy feel, and no smell at all. It suitable for all skin types. I love this product!

Looks like we ran out of this product. Do register to get notified once we've stocked up! Notify Me Product Details Description Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles is an instant and effective eye cream which helps to diminish bags under your eyes and the appearance of dark circles with just one single application per day. You’ll feel refreshed and feel years younger in just a few minutes, all day long. The effectiveness of Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles has also been proven clinically and works for all skin types. Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles gives you an instant effect because of its revolutionary EYESYL technology that immediately targets eye bags & dark circles, by using a unique combination of clay minerals and a bi-peptide complex which will lead to strong skin tightening, a decrease of fluid accumulation under the eyes and a micro-muscular pause.These actions will help to reduce the puffiness of the eyes and eliminate the appearance of dark circles. BENEFITS: • Erases the appearance of eye bags and dark circles in just a few minutes! • Instant visible results • Effective from 1st application • Clinically proven Made in Belgium USAGE: Step 1: Wash your face gently and pat dry. Step 2: Squeeze out a small amount of product on your fingertip. You should aim for the size of a grain of rice; any less will not be enough, and any more is generally too much and won’t fully absorb into the skin or could cause sensitivity. This is one of the key factors to make Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles work correctly. Step 3: Gently apply the cream on your entire under-eye area, and smooth it out from the inside to the outside with one finger. Blend in using a light gentle sweeping motion until the cream completely absorbs into the skin. Step 4: Remain expressionless for 2-3 minutes while the product dries to achieve dramatic results (fanning will accelerate the process). Simply tissue off the excess of cream with a bit of water if too much cream is applied. Wash hands and close the tube after use. For under makeup: First, apply your usual products (eye serum, daily moisturizer, etc.) and allow time for these products to penetrate the layers of your skin (a minute or two). Then you can apply a very thin layer of Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles to the targeted area as instructed above. If you see a white residue you have either used too much product or did not use moisturizer. Simply tissue off the white residue with a bit of water. Once the product has dried, apply your makeup as usual. Note: Oil-based makeup may reduce the effectiveness of Remescar Eye Bags & Dark Circles.

Notify Me Product Details Description Relieve your baby’s nasal congestion with Iliadin® Nasal Decongestant Solution 0.01 % 5ml! One of the leading cough drops for infants, Iliadin comes in an easy-to-use drop format that makes it perfect for babies 1 month to 1 year of age. It effectively offers a fast-acting solution to mucus build-up and nasal congestion. Finally, the cough drop gently clears blocked nose to improve airflow and ease your baby’s breathing. BENEFITS: • Instantly relieves nasal congestion by breaking down mucus structure. • Gently clears baby’s blocked nose to improve airflow. • Promotes breathing ease.

Typically when I start getting a sore throat, it is probably a sign of cold and eventually my nose would get very runny/blocked which would last awhile. This time I took sambucol when I started getting a sore throat and surprisingly, my nose didn't act up!! Mrs Chew 2017-03-27 Stock this at home! I always have this handy at our home. For the just-in-case... It works. Mrs Chong 2017-02-02 have this handy Me and my family are very susceptible to colds and flu. This product from Sambucol is one that I have used and trust.

So when they first introduce their Cetaphil Baby product range, I don't have any second thought and bought it. As my baby developed eczema during his first few months, our doctor prescribed Cetaphil. Within 3 days of using this product...my baby's skin condition improved until the 15th day, no more redness, dryness and itchiness! It's truly effective with very gentle scent and non-sticky feel. Highly recommended!!! Celine Chin 2017-05-09 good value for a good product Thank you for such wonderful value for an established brand like cetaphil. and the prompt delivery. noticed you do have very good brands on the site.

The 3 Best Expectorant Brands for Phlegm-Busting! We’re no strangers to the effects of an annoying, persistent cough—the yucky, sticky phlegm, that swollen, painful throat and chest congestion! For effective relief from all these symptoms, try expectorants for a speedy recovery from coughs! Expectorants help loosen phlegm to make it easier to cough out. It does so by increasing the water content of the mucus, thinning it out so it is easier to be expelled. In this list, we share three phlegm-busting and expectorant-formulated brands that can help lighten and provide immediate comfort from chesty coughs! 1. FLUIMUCIL Fluimucil 100mg Effervescent Granules 30s is perfect for when you’re already feeling heavy and in need of a quick, no-fuss solution for your sore throat. Just dissolve these granules, drink, and feel fast relief from chesty coughs! Formulated to break down phlegm and clear out your lungs, Fluimucil’s Effervescent Granules is a must-have during seasonal influenza. This fast-acting mucolytic agent directly targets the thick and sticky mucus structure in order to clear our airways and provide instant relief from throat and lung congestions. Like its granule counterpart, the Fluimucil A 600mg Effervescent Tablets 10s also dissolves sticky phlegm, therefore clearing the respiratory tract for faster cough relief! Perfect for both adults and children 6 years and older, these handy effervescent tablets allow for an easier phlegm expulsion because of its intense mucolytic agent. 2. LEFTOSE Cough tablets can sometimes cause drowsiness. Good thing there’s the non-drowsy Leftose® Syrup 100ml: Lysozyme Hydrochloride! Prescribed by doctors for over 40 years, Leftose is a 2-in-1 product for chesty coughs and sore throats. This sweet, easy on the taste buds cough syrup is a perfect cough and phlegm remedy especially for kids! This product quickly dissolves phlegm and reduces the inflammation brought on by sore throat. Its immediate and long-lasting effects help to relieve throat pain and swelling effectively. Leftose® 30’s Tablets for Chesty Coughs and Sore Throats contain lysozyme hydrochloride which is a natural enzyme found in the human body - tears, saliva, breastmilk; which helps thin the hard-to-remove phlegm from airways, making it easier to release and cough out. Formulated to be non-drowsy, each tablet provides instant relief from sore throat and reduce inflammation. 3.PROSPAN Backed by over 65,000 rigorous clinical evidence in over 65,000 patients, Prospan is one of the most famous non-drowsy cough remedy in the market! Formulated with the exclusive extract EA 575 or Ivy leaf extract, it serves to provide an impactful and fast relief from chesty cough. In addition, the brand’s products are also sugar-free, making them a perfect natural cough-combat for people of all ages. Prospan Cough Syrup 200ML is a perfect remedy for busy days, especially when you cannot afford to miss out on work and your everyday tasks. Specially formulated for adults, this product naturally remedies the effects of persisting, chesty cough without the drowsiness. It opens the throat airways to relieve chest congestion and break up the mucus build-up effectively! Of course, Prospan comes in a formula perfect for kids! A companion to the adult formula, Prospan Cough Syrup for Children provides the same level of comfort to children’s airways, calming the throat without blocking it up for better relief from mucus build-up. While coughs usually go away after a day or two and are sometimes best left to run its course, they can be made worse by excess phlegm.

This is my go-to probiotic that I take whenever I have any stomach upset or feel bloated. Works wonders....my girl loves it too!! :) ROY S 2021-06-24 Probiotics that works! Been taking this daily for good digestion, taste great and works! Whenever i have diarrhoea or stomachache, Lactomin never fails with 3-4 sachets at one go. The diarrhoea stops and stomachache goes away in a short time. This shows the product works! Highly recommend for good digestion and immunity. Celia Toh 2021-06-22 recommended by the pharmacist this is a good quality probiotic. it is very tasty. my kids are taking lactokids also. good brand. Elizabeth Lim 2021-06-15 Works really well for diarrhoea and constipation Works every time there is a stomach upset. Lactomin is now a staple at home given how it works so well for every tummy upset, does not require refrigeration and best of all, the kids enjoy taking them simply because they taste so good. Sage Lee 2021-06-11 love that it can be kept in room temperature so much more practical. and i will remember to eat them cos i can see them! i have tried with the other brands which require refrigeration and it just doesnt work... out of sight out of mind... Candy 2020-05-22 Lactomin Good tasting probiotics. It's my first time trying. Mary 2020-03-16 Useful supplement, good price Was prescribed this by GP for upset tummy/bloat. Liked how it works and taste, so decided to continue long-term. Glad to find it here and at a reasonable price. Thanks! Serene Ong 2017-08-07 Great for travelling! Grab and go! A friend recommended Lactomin, not many probiotic brands come in sachet packaging. Personally i love sachet packaged products, the ease of travelling with it! You don't need to bring the whole bottle or worry about repackaging tablets. It is so well packed and freshly sealed! My family and i have been taking Lactomin, and it is soooo good! Wiped out all my digestive problems! Highly recommend! Xie Liping 2017-08-07 Well Done Lactomin! My 7 year old daughter loves taking lactomin! She just can't stop popping lactomin! Good thing it a supplement, if not i will be in trouble. She takes once a day, sometimes twice. I have seen her gut improved as she does everything with ease and daily. The taste is so good, she says its like taking ""Horlicks sweet!"" With a healthy digestive system taken care of, she can focus on her priorities. Rick Clay 2017-08-07 Recommended by my GP, Relieved all my digestive problems! A friend told me about this after I told her of my digestive problems. I was not sure I wanted to take on a daily basis. But when my GP agreed I should be taking them. I decided to give it a shot. I have now been taking Lactomin daily for about 2 years and what a difference it really makes! My digestive problems are all gone! Charmaine Kris 2017-08-07 Improved my immunity and my kids love it too! I started taking this about half a year ago and it's been really good. My overall health has improved and I feel alot better. I recommend for everyone....my kids also take it and love it. Especially the taste! Asher Chan 2017-08-07 High quality at affordable price! After spending so much money and so much time trying expensive probiotic products, I finally purchased Lactomin about a 2 weeks ago. I was surprised at how quickly it began to work! I take one in the morning, and all is well! Best part it is priced reasonably and cheaper than other probiotic brands, plus it works as well, if not even better!"" Johnson Yap 2017-08-07 Highly recommend Lactomin! Taste good too! For over 5 years my digestive tract has been like a volatile stock market. Then a year ago, my aunt said that she was having a problem with her digestive tract and she had started taking Lactomin probiotics daily, and she felt so much better. So, I tried them, and after 5 years of my digestive tract controlling me, I finally got in control of my digestive tract. I love this product. It taste so good and works great. Make sure you drink water after taking the powder probiotics! Ryan 2017-07-01 Great-tasting probiotics, convenient to carry around Was first introduced to this by my doctor. Find it very easy to bring around, tastes really good too. MH Wong 2017-06-08 My kids love the taste of this! Very handy to bring for travels (no need for refrigeration), really works (for constipation or diarrhoea) and most importantly, kids love the taste!

GC Tooth Mousse is a delicious tasting, water based, sugar free crème that is beneficial for teeth. It contains calcium and phosphate; the major minerals teeth are made from. Because calcium and phosphate are carried in a special milk-derived protein called Recaldent (CPP-ACP), they are available in a soluble form. This means GC Tooth Mousse provides extra protection for teeth, buffers dental plaque acid from bacteria in the mouth and also protects teeth from acidic foods and drinks. GC Tooth Mousse, the first product for professional use to contain this complex of Recaldent (CPP-ACP), is the ideal delivery system for bio-available calcium and phosphate ions. Tooth Mousse is not toothpaste. It is made of milk products so swallowing the product is safe and it can be used throughout the day. However, because Tooth Mousse is derived from milk protein (casein) it is not suitable for people who have a suspected or proven allergy to milk proteins. Natural defence against caries with for people who: • have a low to medium risk of caries • suffer from white spot lesions • experience hypersensitivity before and after teeth whitening • have had professional procedures such as root scaling or cleaning • for children below the age of six BENEFITS: • It contains CPP-ACP a revolutionary new ingredient that helps to repair and restore tooth enamel. • Tooth Mousse provides relief for sensitive teeth. • Regular use will help protect teeth from decay and make them stronger. • It is sugar and lactose free. • Helps prevent white spots during and after orthodontic brackets. FLAVOUR: Strawberry Made in USA INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Apply to teeth using a clean finger, or cotton tip swab or custom bleaching tray. 2) Leave the Tooth Mousse undisturbed for three minutes in the first instance. 3) Then spread the Tooth Mousse around the mouth with the tongue and hold for a further one or two minutes. 4) Do not to eat or drink for 30 minutes following application.

Glovida® also has a category called Clinic-Exclusives, which retails products usually found only in medical clinics, such as Heliocare Ultra Oral 30’s and Artrex DS Joint Supplement. This means that you can now get products that are not available over the counter, without the hassle of leaving your home. We tried the Glovida® Family Kit which came filled with products for the whole family, from sanitisers, to children’s surgical masks, supplements and hand washes. Twinkle 3-in-1 Hand & Body Sanitizer, $19.90 is just perfect for when you are on the go. We love that it protects the skin against both damaging UV rays as well as germs, bacteria and pollutants. This is a definite must-have in every handbag. Keeping your gut healthy will keep the rest of you in good condition, which is why we love the Lactomin Advance+ Probiotics 30’s, $39.00. One of the most powerful holistic probiotic products developed in Korea and one of Singapore’s most popular probiotics for the whole family, the supplement is powered by essential vitamins B, D, B1, B2, B5, B6, B9 and D3, which work to strengthen immunity and promote better digestion.

Does it work? or is it just marketing hype? Probiotics have gained increasing popularity in recent years, and the market for probiotic supplements and foods is rapidly growing. Some people think that probiotics have been overhyped, while others firmly believe in their potential health benefits. In this article, let’s take a closer look at probiotics and explore the potential health benefits they offer. What are probiotics? In simple terms, probiotics are what is commonly known as ""friendly bacteria"" or ""good bacteria"". These bacteria live naturally in our body and help ensure the proper functioning of our gut. Some common strains of probiotics include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Often, probiotics help protect our body from infections caused by “bad” bacteria or other germs. Probiotics have also been shown to have potential health benefits, such as improving digestive function and boosting the immune system. How do probiotics work? In order to know how probiotics work, we first need to understand how they interact with our gut. Our gut is made up of trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which is collectively known as the microbiome. Some of these microorganisms are harmful, while others are beneficial. Our body is constantly trying to strike a healthy balance between the “good” and “bad” organisms living inside of us. When an imbalance caused by an overgrowth in the “bad” bacteria occurs, our body may experience issues with our digestive and immune systems, such as diarrhoea and infection. Probiotics can therefore help restore the balance in the gut microbiome by increasing the number of “good” microorganisms and decreasing the number of harmful microorganisms. This balance can have a positive effect on the immune system, digestion, and overall health. How do you choose the right probiotics? When choosing probiotics, here are some factors to consider: Types of strains: Different strains of probiotics have different health benefits. For example, some strains are more effective for improving digestive function, while others are better for boosting the immune system. For general health benefits, you may consider choosing a combination that has a wide variety of “good” bacteria strains. CFUs: CFUs, or colony-forming units, measure the number of live probiotics in a product. Look for a product with a high number of CFUs to ensure that you're getting enough beneficial microorganisms. Delivery system: A high number of CFUs alone may not be enough if the probiotics are unable to survive the harsh environment as they travel through the gut. Hence, it is also important to ensure that the probiotics are well coated to protect them from being killed before they reach the intended site of action. Storage conditions: Some probiotics need to be stored in the refrigerator, while others can be stored at room temperature. Make sure to choose a product that can be stored under conditions that are convenient for you. Consult a healthcare professional: If you are still unsure, it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional such as a doctor or pharmacist before taking probiotics to determine if they are appropriate for you. What are the potential side effects and cautions to take note of? Probiotics are generally regarded as safe, but there are some potential side effects and cautions to be aware of. In some instances, people may experience allergic reactions to certain strains of probiotics, and probiotics can also interact with certain medications. Here are a few reasons why someone might choose not to take probiotics: A weakened immune system: If you have a weakened immune system due to a chronic illness or medical treatment such as chemotherapy, you may be at higher risk of infections. Allergy to probiotics: Some people may be allergic to certain strains of probiotics, and may experience allergic reactions such as skin rashes or difficulty breathing. If you experience an allergic reaction after taking probiotics, it's important to stop taking them and consult with a healthcare professional. You are taking certain medications: Some medications, such as antibiotics, can interact with probiotics. It's important to consult with your healthcare professional before taking probiotics if you're taking any medications. If you are still unsure, do consult a healthcare professional such as a doctor or pharmacist to see if probiotics are suitable for you. Product Recommendations for a healthy gut.

Since 1992, Dr Merien has authored/co-authored 113 articles/journals in the area of biomedical science, immunology and molecular diagnostics. NMN plays a key and vital role in celluar repair, hence has anti aging effects. NMN is a precursor to a vital molecule for energy production and metabolic health called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Many studies have already demonstrated that by increasing NAD+ levels throughout the body in animals, NMN improves metabolic health during aging. EZZ NMN provides 4 vital benefits: • Anti Aging properties • Increase Energy Production • Repair Damaged Cells • Reduce Neurological disorders What is NMN? NMN stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide, a molecule naturally occurring in all life forms. NMN is the direct precursor of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and is considered a key component to increase NAD+ levels in cells. NAD+ is an essential coenzyme required for life and cellular functions. What does NAD+ do? NAD+ is the most abundant molecule in the body besides water, and without it, an organism would die. NAD+ is used by many proteins throughout the body, such as the sirtuins, which repair damaged DNA. It is also important for mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cell and generate the chemical energy that our bodies use. In cells, NAD+ serves as that booster. NAD+ can decrease or increase enzyme activity, gene expression, and cell signaling. As organisms grow older, they accrue DNA damage due to environmental factors such as radiation, pollution, and imprecise DNA replication. According to the current aging theory, the accumulation of DNA damage is the main cause of aging. Almost all cells contain the ‘molecular machinery’ to repair this damage. This machinery consumes NAD+ and energy molecules. Therefore, excessive DNA damage can drain valuable cellular resources. Made in Australia DIRECTIONS: Take 1 - 2 tablets with meals daily.

Blackmores Pregnancy & Breast-Feeding Gold 60’s is packed with the essential nutrients needed to support mothers and their babies. All nutrients are important during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The following provides additional information on some special nutrients important during pregnancy and breastfeeding, that are in Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Gold. • Folic acid – According to guidelines in Australia* this product contains 500 micrograms of folic acid, as it is recommended that women of childbearing age take 400-500 μg of folic acid per day for at least one month before pregnancy and for the first 3 months of pregnancy. • Iodine - Requirement for iodine is increased during the whole pregnancy, especially the first 20 weeks. • Iron - Approximately one quarter of pregnant women report getting constipated when taking high doses of supplemental iron. That is why Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Gold contains a low-constipation, low-nausea, gentle on the tummy form of iron. • Omega-3 fatty acids - During pregnancy there can be an increased sensitivity to tastes, especially in the first trimester. Odourless fish oil means pregnant women can get the benefits of omega-3s without the fishy aftertaste. • Vitamin D - Vitamin D supports healthy foetal development. • B group vitamins - Vitamins B2 and B12 support a healthy pregnancy by helping the body to use folic acid. Blackmores Pregnancy & Breast-Feeding Gold provides 20 important nutrients in total including a daily dose of: • 500 microgram of folic acid which, if taken daily for one month before conception and during pregnancy, may reduce the risk of having a child with spina bifida/neural tube defects • 150 microgram of iodine for baby's brain and hearing development • Lower constipation iron • Odourless and concentrated fish oil, rich in DHA for baby's brain and nervous system development Made in Australia DOSAGE: 2 capsules a day with meals, or as professionally prescribed. Do not exceed the stated dose of folic acid. EXPIRY DATE: 06-Feb-2025 Rating & Reviews 4.5 /5 5 Ratings Love our product?

I have really fine hair, so it definitely adds volume without weighing down my hair or adding to product build up. I can still go a couple days without washing my hair - whereas other volumizing products I've used I have to wash my hair everyday as it feels greasy after the first day. Diana 2017-06-26 Really Works!! I have tried lots of different hair volumizers, with varying degrees of success. This one tops them all. I will be reordering this. It's a little pricey, but worth it!!! Arielle 2017-05-05 I absolutely love this product! I have been hearing about the volumizing tonic but never quite got down to it. I am now a convert! It gives the hair a volume boost, without any sticky residue and gives a good hair day everyday! (Great price and service by the way) Kelly Kristine 2017-03-20 love this! this is my favourite item product of all the Aveda range of products! Casey Neo 2017-01-10 love it! this is my go-to and I always buy it after my visit to the salon. love the price here and I buy the shampoo and conditioner together to have it delivered to my house. fuss-free, easy, efficient and wonderful service by the team at Glovida. Excellent! Jan 2016-11-14 Got this for my hubby, very prompt delivery and easy to order The husband's been using this for years. Glad to find it here. Cheaper!

It contains a special mix of 5 different, scientifically-selected butyrate enhancing lactobacillus probiotic bacteria, and is supported by an effective prebiotic. Each capsule contains 10 times the amount of natural bacteria as a large yogurt. It is also supported by an effective prebiotic soluble fibre, inulin which aids the gut microbiome. There’s no recommended amount of probiotics one should consume daily. Most numbers vary from 1 to 10 billion that you can consume once or twice daily. A lack of probiotics might hinder your progress. However, this doesn’t mean consuming more is the best option. The vegetable-based slow-release capsules are designed to dissolve later, and bypass the stomach to the gut, withstanding stomach acids, where the healthy bacteria can perform its functions. This allows the probiotics inside to be unaffected b other substances. Exposure to the stomach acids will result in the probiotics being destroyed and not establishing itself in the gastrointestinal tract, which will render consuming YourgutPlus+ ineffective. YourgutPlus+ contains multi-strain, scientifically tested, lactobacillus probiotics which are non-dairy. These help to break down healthy foods and nourish the gut lining cells, maintaining a healthy gut wall. BENEFITS: • Scientifically selected for the national Phyto-V nutritional intervention study • Patented delayed release vegan capsule – bacteria get to where they are most needed. 100% Natural, lactose, gluten and artificial chemical free • Multi-strain clinically proven lactobacillus probiotics which help to break down healthy foods and feed the gut lining cells maintaining gut wall integrity• 10 Billion colony forming units (CFU) per day (10 times the CFU of an average live yogurt) which improve the diversity of gut flora • Vitamin D3 enhancement and bioactivation – Contains more than enough of the RDA so you do not have to take extra vitamin D supplements.  Vitamin D combined with probiotics is known to greatly improve  absorption, bioavailability and healthy functions of vitamin D • Made by a trusted UK company with comprehensive quality assurance certification including Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) so has a high safety profile possible. • Suitable for Vegetarians Made in UK INGREDIENTS: Probiotics: Lactobacillus Plantarum, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactococcus Lactis, Lactobacillus Paracasei. Anti Caking Agents; Magnesium Stearate, Microcrystalline Cellulose. Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol). Delayed Released Capsule; Plant Hypromellose And Gellan Gum.

David 2017-06-26 Saved Money This product works well to keep my thinning hair a little thicker. Better priced at GLOVIDA Tze Ting 2017-06-26 My Favourite This conditioner was recommended to me by my Aveda salon a couple of years ago. I am still using it because it made a noticable difference in the shine and perceived thickness of my hair. This has made quite an improvement. Lindy 2017-04-03 Can you have this in the bigger size too? That would really be added convenience and value. :) Zwendy 2016-11-14 Yea! Been searching online for better prices. Quite challenging to find aveda products online. Glad you stock this. Price is pretty good.

Had a couple of episodes with acne caused by extended periods of mask-wearing and usually the acne clears up the next morning after the skin b5 mask. Really good product.

Between us, we have decades of healthcare, medical, marketing and sales experience. Why did we start Glovida? Because we believe that it is important to offer consumers the best in healthcare and beauty, at better prices and greater convenience. We believe the era of ecommerce is already here, and a dedicated platform that offers the best in health & beauty with ready information is much needed in the Asian context. If we are not eating, sleeping or breathing Glovida, we are praying. Praying that that our platform can truly add value to the lives of those whom we touch, be it providing a reliable source of health & beauty essentials at better prices (please note that we do not believe in constant price-slashing and bleeding ourselves & other competitors to death, but abide in giving CONSISTENT good value and service for money) or simply being a very accessible platform for others to source and ask about health and medical related topics dear to their hearts. After all, health is the greatest wealth. This is what got us started on the journey of Glovida. Glovida is made up of the words ""Glow"" and ""Vida"", which means ""Life"" in Spanish. We want to empower all our customers to embrace life and live life healthier. OUR VALUES These are values we live by and represent our promise to you: AUTHENTIC We care for your wellbeing like we care for ours. That is why we do not sell what we will not use on ourselves. We endeavour to bring in only genuine, quality and trusted products that you can use with confidence. Our vitamins & supplements are stored in 24-hour air-conditioned warehouses at all times to ensure product quality is never compromised. GENEROUS We offer unbeatable prices by passing back substantial savings to you. That means you only pay for the product and delivery, unlike at brick-and-mortar stores where overheads like high rental and labour costs are added to the final retail price you pay. HONEST We hold ourselves to fair, ethical standards and practices. While our prices are reduced, we do not cut corners on what we offer and how we serve you. At all times, with no exceptions. ENLIGHTENING Value does not end at our low prices – we offer professional evaluation of the products and offer you a platform to ""ask our pharmacists"" for health queries that concern you and your family. RELATABLE We see ourselves, first as consumers; so we are able to understand and meet your needs. PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.

It’s a non medicated saline nasal spray that clears the sinus by breaking down the mucus structure to relieve congestion and offering fast and effective relief from allergies, especially during bouts of sinusitis, hay fever, and colds.

BENEFITS: • Naturally relieves congestion by thinning and clearing excess mucus. • Protects from dust and other pollutants, especially allergens that cause hay fever. • Promotes and strengthens nasal health by neutralising the acidity in the sinus cavity. • Softens dried blood for post-operative care so as not to irritate sinus passages. • Suitable for use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.

Did a quick search online and found that you guys sell it! Was so happy and even happier with the next day delivery!!! Thank you and great job on your industry knowledge and resourcefulness! Georgia 2019-09-24 stock up on this! I always lug this back when I travel to Australia! This works very well for my sensitive nose and allergies.

Really quick turnaround and great service from Glovida, price is very competitive as well compared to retail outlets. Yin Ling Leong 2022-12-11 Regular order This probiotic works well for me therefore I'm ordering it regularly Amanda Tee 2021-12-16 Regular orders for my parents I got my 60something year old parents started on probiotics. I wanted vivomixx for them because most doctors recommend it but it’s such a hassle to get it from hospitals or stores. Glovida is great in terms of pricing, customer relations and product assurance! I work in Japan at the moment and I’m so glad that I can order probiotics on behalf of my parents hassle free through glovida! Gloria Koh 2021-11-02 Vivomixx Probiotics Caps 30's This probiotics has been really helpful to ensuring a healthy gut. i experienced extreme bloating and it really helped to ease the bloating and been having healthy gut since i started on this 2 years ago. Yin Ling Leong 2021-06-14 effective so far had been having these for months and it works well for me Megan Behler 2021-06-08 been getting my regular supply here thank you for consistently delivering it to me so promptly each order. love that i can use my points to exchange for vouchers to offset my purchase. Teresa Shiu 2020-10-13 Good for whole family Great live bacteria without the sugar content from usual probiotic drinks. Love buying here not only it's cheaper, but I don't need to worry about transporting vivomixx myself without cold bag. Margaret 2020-04-11 It helps me to reduce my gastric problem. It help me to reduce gastric problem. Huey 2018-11-16 Superb Product is effective and Glovida service is superb. I just purchased half an hour ago and i got msg from the delivery guy - to say that they will deliver it by today...Woah! Cold pack will be included for the probiotics - maintain the viability. Victor 2018-03-11 Highly Effective Probiotic Product. Much Better Than Any Yogurt, Yakult and Vitagen A truly effective probiotic product that contains much higher levels of good bacteria when compared to any yogurt or probiotic drinks like Yakult or Vitagen. Also does not contain additional sugar content, which helps reduce risk of diabetes. Everyone's immune system is within his very own digestive system. So, when you want to keep your body healthy, in addition to healthy eating and exercise habits, you have to keep your digestive system healthy as well by making sure the levels of good bacteria (which is not naturally produced in our bodies) in your gut is maintained daily. Ever since taking Vivomixx, my digestion and bowel movement has greatly improved, and I am truly thankful that this has also helped me stay healthy, especially during the recent flu season a few months ago. A good sign that my immune system has strengthened as well. Calise 2018-02-24 Fantastic product A colleague recommended vivomixx to me as it helped her with her gastro problems. I have been taking one per day for 2 months now and it really makes a difference! No more constipation and moving bowels is a breeze! I no longer feel bloated after meals. I will be back for more. Glovida keeps their probiotics well chilled and ensures they deliver it that way too. Thumbs up! VL 2018-01-15 Good Product Good Product. Helps keep my digestive system working properly. Jeslyn 2017-09-06 GREAT PRODUCT Tried this product after reading the reviews. Been suffering from constipation since young and occasionally indigestion. Today is the 3rd day i been taking, so far smooth bowel movement. Thumbs up! Will take this for long term. Lily 2017-08-31 Very nice product Thanks to Glovida for sending this probiotic with ice pack. Price is cheaper than pharmacy outside, surely will purchase from u again :) Seah 2017-07-17 Effective Have IBS since young. Was quite skeptical when I was introduced to this product by a pharmacist.. tried it since April this year..  Bloatedness much reduced & most of the time, don't give too much of problem whenever I take it. But Once I stop, it's back to normal. Guess lifestyle & diet plays a part too. -Will Continue taking to maintain my gut health.. Price also lower than those at retail store (if no promotion going on.) Happy to discover this product :) Sarah 2017-06-20 Great product  I had digestive issues after 2 rounds of antibiotics. Bloating, gas , tummy aches. But one capsule of this every morning took care of it. I no longer wake up to stomachaches, or uncomfortable gas after lunch, this has also normalized my bowel patterns. 5 stars. I will repurchase and take it for as long as I need to. Will definitely bring this overseas when I travel too. Thank God for this as it gave me great relief from all these uncomfortable stomach problems. 3 cheers! Jerry 2017-03-21 I'm impressed Impressed with the excellent service. My questions were answered promptly and goods were delivered the very next day. Glovida's team delivered it personally to ensure quality control. Keep up the good work! Jolyn 2017-01-17 Great product at a great price! Much cheaper at Glovida especially when there's no promotion at retail stores. Great delivery service too. Small ice pack included to ensure the product is kept at the right temperature. wan 2017-01-14 Very effective product I have been taking vivomaxx since mid 2015. It was known as vs#3 then. I think it helps intestinal problem like bowel disorder or ibs-like problems. Was recommended by my gastroenterologist. Glovida not only sells vivomaxx cheaper than other pharmacies, it provides very good service. The probiotics which contain live bacteria was personally couriered to ensure its quality not compromised. I would definitely buy from Glovida again. gordon 2017-01-09 quick and reliable my supply ran low and I didn't have time to go to my regular pharmacy to buy. did a google search and glovida came out. decided to try and was pleasantly surprised at the swift delivery. (I ordered in the morning and got the items the very next working day!). and it's at a lower price than I usually paid too. I checked the item thoroughly when it arrived. totally authentic too! I'll be back. :) june 2016-10-31 good price I buy this regularly from the local pharmacy. better price here! please keep the competitive prices. leo 2016-09-30 great, this is my favourite probiotics brand. Bel75 2016-08-31 Glad you stock this Thanks for answering my query on the storage facilities. Was assuring to know you stock your probiotics in air-conditioned warehouses. The pharmacist recommended this and I have been taking this regularly for gut health. Works better for me than the other brands somehow.

It helps clear a child’s runny or blocked nose quickly, gently and easily. It delivers a gentle, non-medicated, preservative-free nasal saline that is suitable for daily use. Using Flo Kids can help relieve a kid’s nasal symptoms due to COLDS and ALLERGIES because it can: • Wash away mucus including excessive mucus produced by colds, pollens, dust and other allergy-causing particles • Help remove mucus plugs in the nose. • Moisturise nasal tissues. • Help prevent scabbing in the nose.

This award-winning antiaging neck cream is formulated with a complex of three ingredients, each with a unique action to target visible discoloration and reduce visible signs of aging on the neck and décolletage for skin that appears firmer, lifted and more evenly toned. NeoGlucosamine, NeoCitriate and Pro-Amino Acid work together to firm the appearance of sagging skin and target skin’s volumizing matrix. Clinically proven, NeoGlucosamine and NeoCitrate are able to plump up the wrinkles and lines through the synthesis of Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen, restoring youth to the skin. Furthermore, NeoGlucosamine helps to create a supportive skin structure and reduces discoloration and age spots in the neck. Bolstered with Pro-Amino Acid, it helps stimulate pro-collagen production in the skin’s deep layers, ensuring the reversal of wrinkles formation. This potent cream is fortified with Apple Stem Cell Extract to help protect the longevity of skin’s essential cells, helping your skin to behave like younger skin. Ideal for anyone seeking a more even-toned, firmer, lifted appearance for the delicate neck area. This potent antiaging neck cream is ideal for dry, normal and oily skin types. BENEFITS: • Reduces visible signs of ageing on the neck and decolletage for skin that appears firmer, lifted and more evenly toned • Reduces the look of creases, lines and wrinkles • Helps reduce the appearance of uneven tone on the decolletage • Oil-Free Made in USA KEY INGREDIENTS: NeoGlucosamine, NeoCitriate, Pro-Amino Acid DIRECTIONS: Apply to clean skin on neck and décolletage twice daily. Gently massage in with an upward motion. EXPIRY DATE: 31-May-2025 Rating & Reviews 5 /5 1 Ratings Love our product?

It's soothing and calming for rashes, itch, insect bites and inflammation. Simply love it! Leslye Chan 2021-06-08 must try read the great reviews by other users and decided to try. and it is really one of the best aloe vera gel i've tried. Katharine Tan 2020-10-06 Safe and good It's nice to know this particular aloe vera gel does not contain paraben or any toxic/harmful ingredients. It has been very useful to calm my husband's sunburnt skin recently, and my kid's insect bites area. But it does not work that well on my eczema-ish skin though. Always patch test first. Huey 2020-07-28 RELIEVES & SOOTHES THE ""SENSITIVE TO MASK"" FACE Have been having some redness on my face, after wearing the mask out for the day. Tried applying Acuralle aloe vera gel and it works perfectly well to calm my skin. Yes, value for money too :) AGNES 2020-04-30 About the great healing effect of Acurelle Aloe Vera Gel Have been looking for an aloe gel without paraben for a long time. Found this just as I needed one the most. My right palm had blisters and a deep open wound due to some harsh hand washing agents. Acuralle aloe vera gel soothed the painful blisters in minutes, wound was closed by the next day of application.

Cold Sore Serum is the innovative and effective way to treat cold sore symptoms easy and fast. Herpatch Cold Sore Serum can be applied easily on the cold sore with the easy to use tube. The healing property of the serum is activated once applied to the skin and forms a transparent patch over the wound to protect it instantly. It soothes the affected area and shields the skin to minimise the appearance of cold sores. Finally, it speeds up the healing process of the affected areas with its improved active oxygen formula to minimise the burning and itching pain. BENEFITS: • Serum turns into a protective film that protects the wound instantly. • Has active oxygen property to speed up the healing process of affected areas. • Hides and minimises the appearance of scars. • Effectively helps prevent itching, burning sensation, and scabbing over wounds. • Powerfully protects the wound over possible virus spread. • Has skin firming and toning properties. • Reduces swelling, redness, and blistering. • Painless removal. Made in Belgium HOW TO USE: 1) Before use, make sure that your hands are clean and dry. 2) Wash or rinse the affected area. 3) Gently apply the film-forming Serum on the cold sore so that it adequately covers all lesions and a margin of healthy skin surrounding them. 4) After a few minutes, the white serum forms a protective and transparent film over the cold sore. 5) The Serum can be reapplied, if necessary, every 3-4 hours until the cold sore is completely healed. The film can be removed, if necessary, with warm water. You can use Herpatch Cold Sore Serum at any stage of the outbreak. However, we suggest applying it at first sign of an outbreak.

Here Are the Best Probiotic Supplements for You For most of us, the very first exposure to probiotics is in the little yummy bottle of Yakult drink. That’s when we first learn about the good bacteria in the body and how having more of them is good for our digestive system and health. We’ve come a long way since then. Now with probiotics being the latest buzz word in the world of health supplements, we see a myriad of probiotic products everywhere we go. You have probiotic drinks, cereal, coffee and more food and drinks claiming to be filled with healthy strains of probiotics. And of course, there’s Yakult - one of the most popular probiotic drink, isn’t it? But do you really know what’s in your favourite morning drink? Turns out, a lot of questionable stuff that you don’t expect to find! According to health and fitness coach Alex Fergus, Yakult is filled with a dizzying amount of unhealthy sugar! It actually contains 10.2 grams of sucrose which translates to 2.5 teaspoons of pure sugar - this makes its sugar content greater than the amount found in coke per 100ml! In addition, it also consists of skim milk and other artificial sweeteners that are harmful to one’s body! So all you who’ve sworn-off drinking coke altogether, you might also have to rethink your Yakult consumption. Given that Yakult’s no longer the best option, what are other probiotic alternatives? The answer is simple! PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENTS! Not only do they help boost a child’s growing immunity, it also strengthens one’s digestive system regardless of age!

Philip Khoo 2017-03-27 This is a good quality product I usually buy multiples to make sure that there is always stocked up at home. gertrude 2016-12-27 good product this is a good product. my kids have sensitive skin and it is very stressful for me whenever the eczema acts up. (the humid weather here doesnt help too). i have tried many products. and this was recommended by the doctor when we visited the clinic. I didnt have a chance to go back to the clinic to buy it (too busy taking care of the kids' activities!). so I did a search and found it here. now i get my regular supply from a trustworthy source. thank you Glovida. mama may 2016-12-13 great for my twins i buy this for my twins. it's great. love the home delivery service too. Yee55 2016-10-21 My family has been using this for years and years... I have been finding it quite hard to find it at the pharmacies, and was very glad to have found it here. Given that we use it so regularly, price better be cheap!! Thanks! Related Products PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.
