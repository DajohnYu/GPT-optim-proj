    [PSA] Steam Wallet is NOT an approved trade type. You will be banned. 




https://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/33u8wr/psa_rules_and_guidelines_v30/

    No trades involving CD-keys, game codes, serials, or redeemable cards (Steam Wallet, Amazon, iTunes, or other gift cards) will be permitted. This rule also applies to any and all Humble Bundles, as we believe they should not be purchased with the intent to profit.
  
    Steam wallet is not approved as it provides a vector of attack to hijack accounts. Any trades using the above will result in a ban.
