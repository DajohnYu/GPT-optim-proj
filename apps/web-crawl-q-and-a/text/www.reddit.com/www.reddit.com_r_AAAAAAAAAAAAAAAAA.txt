Rules









1


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

















    Posts must be related to AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. No BBBBBBBBBBB spam or any other letter/number/whatever.
  














2


No reposting

















    Don't repost content If content hasn't been posted in ages AND isn't a super popular/frequent post, it may be allowed.
  














3


No NSFW

















    Do not post any not safe for work content - No porn, gore, etc.
  














4


No absolutely garbage awful posts

















    Shitposting is fine but if the post is just genuine garbage it'll be removed. No blatant karmawhoring, awardswhoring. Posting gross=ban. Hardcore spam=ban. Too horny=ban. CHAINPOSTING=PERMABAN
  














5


Asking for upvotes/hinting at wanting them

















    Per reddiquette, it is not allowed to hint at wanting upvotes nor asking for them.
  














6


No political shilling/super hilarious edgy content

















    If your post is political, about a politician/political event, pushing any kind of political agenda, or just some 14 year old edgelord with a WWI German general profile pic shit, it'll be removed and you might get banned (depending on how much of a cringy weirdo you are, no you're not an ironic communist you're just an asshole and nobody finds it funny).
  














7


No self promotion/Tiktok posts

















    No self promotion. Don't have a big watermark, a link to your instagram, etc. Tiktok posts inherently have a watermark attached, so these are removed also. Plus they're never funny, so.
  














8


TOS/Reddiquette

















    Follow the TOS and reddiquette. Basically, don't be a dick, don't harass, don't brigade, no bigotry. Self-explanatory.
