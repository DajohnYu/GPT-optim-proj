Rules









1


No Sub For Sub Posts or using the word "Sub" or Subscribe in the post title (it is assumed)

















    Yes the purpose of this subreddit is sub4sub and Subscribing to your channel, but just don't put it in the title of your post.   Post the name of your video.  (If I don't have this rule, every single post will say the same thing sub4sub or sub to me etc...)
  














2


Please only type the NAME OF YOUR VIDEO or the NAME OF YOUR CHANNEL in the TITLE of the post.

















    If I don't enforce this the entire sub will have titles like: "Look at my video"  "Sub to me"  "Check out my new channel" Etc Etc.  Please only type in the name of your video or the name of your channel in the title of your post.
  









3


No You Tube Links in Title.















4


Duplicate posts of exact same video within 1 hour

















    Post away as many unique videos as you want!  Post the same video multiple times!  Post lots of different videos one right after the other!  But please don't post the same video and then post it again and then again..... all within in a few minutes.
  














5


Profanity

















    No Profanity in the subreddit post.   I can't monitor if you curse in your videos (and I don't really care anyway...)  But no curse-laden posts, please.  Come on.
  














6


Pornography

















    No pornography on subreddit allowed
  














7


Illegal Stuff

















    Removed a video on how to 'crack an account' on Fortnite.  As the subreddit gains in popularity, lets keep the videos legal and within the boundaries of common sense.
