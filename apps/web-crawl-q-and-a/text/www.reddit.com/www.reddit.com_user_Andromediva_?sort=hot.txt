•General Questions and Purchasing Advice Thread — Week of August 07, 2023

    Hello! I'm new to the EV community and am heavily considering getting an EV instead of a gas car. I am planning to lease one as I want to see how it fits in my lifestyle first before fulling committing to purchasing and wanted to know if anyone could help advise on the best EV to purchase? Below is more info:
  
    [1] LOCATION: I will be moving to Michigan (In the US) in 9 months
  
    [2] BUDGET: No more than $55,000.
  
    [3] The type of vehicle you'd prefer: SUV, or sedan.
  
    [4] Which cars have you been looking at already?
  
    I'm torn between the Ford Mustang Mach E (I can get a Ford A Plan discount), or a Tesla. I had seen a lot of QA issues with Tesla, which makes me go back to the Mustang, but then I heard a lot of great things tech-wise in the Tesla. I've done some research on other brands as well, but I feel like the amount of EVs can be overwhelming.
  
    [5] Estimated timeframe of your purchase

    I will be leasing one starting in April of 2024. Not sure how much time is needed beforehand to make sure the car is ready by then...
  
    [6] Your daily commute, or average weekly mileage

    I work from home, so not really much commuting... I will be commuting about 80 miles round trip once a week. Otherwise, just basically staying within the 30-40 mile radius throughout the week, with an occasional road trip.
  
    [7] Your living situation?

    Living in a single-family home.
  
    [8] Do you plan on installing charging at your home?
  
    Yes, I will hire an electrician to come install a charging station at my house.
  
    [9] Other cargo/passenger needs — do you have children/pets?

    We have one dog and one cat, and we will definitely be driving with them in the car.
