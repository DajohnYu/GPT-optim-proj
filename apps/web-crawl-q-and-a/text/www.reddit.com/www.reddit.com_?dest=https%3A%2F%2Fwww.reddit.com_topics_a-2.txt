    What actor that is beloved that you can't stand? *hot take*
  



    Bill Murray. His characters are always an ignorant asshole who respects no one else's boundaries. Ghostbusters is a great example. I enjoy Scrooge at points and What About Bob but 90% of those movies he's still ignoring boundaries or being a dick. Even Groundhog Day he's a horrible human. I get he's supposed to be the heel with a turn but damn its grating.
