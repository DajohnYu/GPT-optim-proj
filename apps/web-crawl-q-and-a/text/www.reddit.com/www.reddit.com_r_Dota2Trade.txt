    [H] Padda'pon of Ribbi'tar (Bright Green) - Preview Attached [W] Arcana or Keys
  



    The Item is $60 and the Gem is $68.
  
    I know it's priced at half of whatever is less + Item value so I am looking for $95-100 in items. Will take Arcana or Tf2 keys or Other valuable items.
  
    Please don't low ball and I know how these items work (Similar to TB)
  
    Add me to discuss. Video Preview
