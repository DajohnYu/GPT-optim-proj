    Yeah it's nothing. The cars that have more accurate epa range still go less far then a teslas real range
  
    Example
  
    Mache E that gets 250 miles EPA and 250 real world highway
  
    Tesla model Y that has 330 miles EPA and 280 real world highway

    That's the point. CCS chargers are absolutely terrible.

    Model Y is the best value hands down. QA issues on fit and finish can be slightly annoying but they have the most reliable and efficient drivetrain. Period

    What are your build quality concerns with Tesla? Fit and finish? Drivetrain reliability? If you care about getting from point a to point B reliably Tesla has every single car you listed beat. Fit and finish is where they are behind. Also where is the Model Y in your choices? The Y is the best value on the market right now. Lastly also wondering what you mean by having a mileage concern with the model 3. Can you explain?

    What do you mean by quality control issues with teslas? Teslas are known for annoying panel gaps or rattling interior trim pieces that might need to be adjusted after delivery. However when it comes to.thr battery pack, motors (drivetrain) there is nothing more reliable than a Tesla. They are years ahead of all the other car makers in this area but behind in the visual fit and finish. Does that help?

    Rivian R1S if you don't care about driving it out of town. You have to downsize to a Tesla if you do. Why? Charging infrastructure

    Teslas are the most reliable EV you can buy when it comes to getting from Point A to point B. Literally nothing compares. Where teslas quality control issues are is only with fit and finish. That means you might have an annoying rattle that needs to be tightened on interior trim or panel gaps. Pick your poison in what you care about most. A reliable proven electric drivetrain by Tesla or a legacy high quality  interior with no panel gaps but are completely beta testing their battery packs and electric motors.
