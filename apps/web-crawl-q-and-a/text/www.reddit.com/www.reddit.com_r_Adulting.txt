    Anyone feeling lost in life?
  



    25M, have been working for a year or so after attaining my bachelor’s. Life is alright - comfortable, I have a loving partner, alls good on a whole. But everyday I feel lost, in a sense I fail to see what the purpose of my life is and whether anything matters in the end. I struggle with making decisions, and I overthink and worry about the future more than I should. Particularly because I’m thinking of moving elsewhere, changing jobs, etc. Tips to cope for a mid-20s “fake” adult?

    How do you eat daily and not spend a fortune?
  



    So i work an extremely demanding job with long hours and have zero time to cook or grocery shop.  I find myself eating out and ordering constantly which is a big expense.  How do you combat this?

1


Don't be a dick

















    Everyone's adulting journey is different and should be respected. Disrespectful / rude comments will be removed.
  














2


No Medical Advice

















    Do not ask for or provide medical advice. The only correct answer is to ask your doctor. Do not post your random bug bites for identification.

No NSFW Content

















    No porn, OnlyFans, FeetFinder, escorts, etc. There's 100+ other subs for that. Keep it out of here.
