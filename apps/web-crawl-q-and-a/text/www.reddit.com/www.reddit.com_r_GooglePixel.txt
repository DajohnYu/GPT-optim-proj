    What are your top reasons to ditch iPhones and Apple
  



    Now this is something that I want to hear your guys's opinions on from people here that know someone themselves or themselves moved from using an iPhone to a pixel phone and enjoy the experience to a degree cuz I think all phones have their headaches here and there. But if you would recommend to somebody who has an iPhone to move to a pixel phone, why?
  
    For me not being somebody who had an iPhone at all I'm an Android person but I would say from what I've seen from my mom moving from an iPhone to a pixel 7 Pro that a pixel phone is a great starting point for somebody going from an iPhone to an Android phone. I know they're not like a one to one experience, but in terms of simplicity, they pixel phone is the closest to a iPhone, but I feel it's a gateway into Android. Gives you a starting point to learn basic features and everything and then if you ever want to, you can try it. Probably thousands of different phones. It's probably thousands of different phone manufacturers and new ones popping up every once in a while like nothing, phones and everything. So for me it would be like a starting point/ gateway into Android for someone who's never used Android
  
    I want to hear what you guys would say is the reasons one that you moved from Apple and iPhones to Android and why you specifically picked a pixel phone?

Rules









1


Pertains to Google Pixel devices or #madebygoogle.

















    General r/Google or r/Android content should be posted to those subreddits. This includes, but is not limited to vague statements from reviewers, content creators, etc, along with non-Pixel related Android OS content, as well as app related issues that are not specific to the Pixel devices. In addition, threads that deviate into political discussions may be locked.
  














2


No battery posts unless excepted.

















    To reduce repeated questions on r/GooglePixel, all battery-related content is only allowed in the Megathread. The only allowed posts are of officially reported issues on Google Product Forums or Issue Tracker, or official changes made by Google. These posts must be approved by the mods.
  














3


No low effort submissions, memes, or NSFW content.

















    Support posts must include self-text for context/information, and cannot be dependent on photos. Low effort, meme, or NSFW content will be removed. Disturbing images of Pixel devices (usually destroyed) can be set to NSFW. If set as NSFW, a moderator will add the NSFP (Not Safe For Pixel) flair. FYI vs PSA.















4


No self promotion, URL shorteners, referral/affiliate links/codes, or spam.

















    All forms of self promotion are strictly prohibited, including but not limited to YouTube content, blogs/articles, apps, etc. Do not use URL shorteners, such as goo.gl, bit.ly, tinyurl.com, or amzn.com, to obscure the true destination of the link. With the exception of Google Photos, all such links are strictly prohibited from r/GooglePixel. Blogspam and other forms of spam are not permitted.
  














5


No flaming or trolling.

















r/GooglePixel discourages disparaging, inciteful, and inflammatory comments against other users. Please participate in meaningful discourse. Tremendously obscene or malicious statements may be removed with or without explanation. Instant bans will be issued during launch periods.
  














6


No misleading/non-descriptive/clickbait titles, disinformation or illegal content.

















    Misleading, non-descriptive, or clickbait titles are prohibited. Non-editorialized original titles of articles/videos/content/etc that exemplify this behaviour are exempt. Content that has been proven false beyond reasonable doubt is strictly prohibited. Do not direct others to perform illegal actions. Links to direct downloads, pirated, unlawful, or malicious content is strictly prohibited.
  














7


Keep reposts to a minimum.

















    While not always strictly enforced, moderators may act in situations where new submissions detract from the welfare of the subreddit.
  














8


AmAs, Q&As, giveaways, etc. require mod approval.

















    These posts require a greater level of vigilance and moderation to protect both the OP and the community from potential abuses. Giveaway operators must cover all costs.
  














9


Restricted topics

















    Purchasing decision & order related posts goes in respective megathreads. Showcasing media taken with Pixel devices goes in weekly megathread or r/Pixelography. Follow this superthread for the appropriate megathread. r/GooglePixel is not a marketplace, buying/selling/trading/offering services is prohibited. Asking about availability of current month's update are prohibited. We aren't monitored by Google, feature requests are prohibited.
