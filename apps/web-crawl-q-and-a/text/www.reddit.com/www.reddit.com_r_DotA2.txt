Rules









1


Fake Patch Submission

















    Users posting deceiving fake patch / update threads will have their posts removed and be subject to a 2 week ban.
  














2


Shitpost

















    Posts falling under the designation of "shitpost" (low quality, meme, non-serious, deceptive, shitty submissions) are subject to removal based on:
  


    The quality/creativity of the content
  


    The usefulness of the discussion
  


    Upvoted for comedic effect
  


    The ratio of similar shitposts populating the front page
  


    User reports
  


    Moderator discretion
  
















3


Unrelated Content

















    All content must be related to Dota 2, not just the title. Unrelated content may be:
  
    *Something not related to Dota that reminds you of something Dota related.
  


    Generic image macros. Image macro posts/memes must feature actual Dota 2 related images. Dota images edited over non Dota images do not count.
  


    Dota 2 personalities doing something unrelated to Dota 2.
  


    Posts relating to Steam or Valve.
  


    Screenshots of conversations.
  


    Content similar to or inspired by Dota 2 material
  
















4


Aggressive or Offensive Material

















    Any racist, homophobic, sexist or otherwise hateful speech or material is strictly prohibited.
  
    No excessive trolling! Keep your comments related to the submission you're commenting on. Don't post comments directly insulting another commenter. A bad attitude is not a ban-worthy reason, but continuously insulting others without contributing to the topic is.
  














5


Spoilers

















    Please keep post titles spoiler free for recent results.
  
    24 hour rule in effect for recent matches spoiling other users on the front page.
  














6


Witch-hunting

















    Any submission or comment that asks the community to participate in vigilante justice will be removed.
  
    Posts should not be made for single incidents or individuals, but for discussions on wider phenomena, with supporting examples cited where relevant.
  
    Blur out names of players where appropriate, to keep them anonymous.
  
    If you're making an accusation against a person or organization, make sure to provide evidence for what you claim
  














7


Repost / Duplicate

















    This post is a duplicate of something that has been posted within the past 2 weeks.
  














8


Missing attribution / stolen content

















    Content that is not posted by the original creator should have proper attribution.
  














9


AI generated content

















    Submissions that contain AI generated art (Midjourney, Hotpot etc.), AI voice impersonations, or ChatGPT content are not allowed.
  














10


Overrepresented Shoutout Threads

















    Submissions that are shoutout threads for established talent who are frequently mentioned on the subreddit can be taken down. Shoutout threads should be received for new talent or duos that have not received substantial representation before.
