    How to grocery shop efficiently? 




    I'm 20 years old and currently live with my grandparents. I work at a restaurant and usually just eat food there/take food home, but I'm currently on a leave of absence due to having surgery, so that's no longer an option. Though I can cook, I don't do it often, partially because I don't like other people being in the kitchen with me (mostly my grandmother, who I don't get along with) and partially because I am awful at grocery shopping. I tend to order UberEats and Doordash a lot because I have object permanence when it comes to groceries- I buy food, then I forget that I've bought it until it goes bad and I have to throw it out. However, I understand constantly ordering out is a waste of money when I could just prepare food for myself, so I'm trying to start cooking more. Does anyone have tips for how to grocery shop efficiently? If it helps, I don't grocery shop in person and haven't since 2020. Supermarkets and grocery stores overwhelm me quite a bit, so I use Instacart instead.
