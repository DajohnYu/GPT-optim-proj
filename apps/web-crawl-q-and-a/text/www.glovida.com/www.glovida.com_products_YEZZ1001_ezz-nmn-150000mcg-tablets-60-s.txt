NMN plays a key and vital role in celluar repair, hence has anti aging effects. 
NMN is a precursor to a vital molecule for energy production and metabolic health called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Many studies have already demonstrated that by increasing NAD+ levels throughout the body in animals, NMN improves metabolic health during aging.
EZZ NMN provides 4 vital benefits:
• Anti Aging properties
• Increase Energy Production
• Repair Damaged Cells
• Reduce Neurological disorders
What is NMN?
NMN stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide, a molecule naturally occurring in all life forms. NMN is the direct precursor of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and is considered a key component to increase NAD+ levels in cells. NAD+ is an essential coenzyme required for life and cellular functions.
What does NAD+ do?
NAD+ is the most abundant molecule in the body besides water, and without it, an organism would die. NAD+ is used by many proteins throughout the body, such as the sirtuins, which repair damaged DNA. It is also important for mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cell and generate the chemical energy that our bodies use.
In cells, NAD+ serves as that booster. NAD+ can decrease or increase enzyme activity, gene expression, and cell signaling. As organisms grow older, they accrue DNA damage due to environmental factors such as radiation, pollution, and imprecise DNA replication.
According to the current aging theory, the accumulation of DNA damage is the main cause of aging. Almost all cells contain the ‘molecular machinery’ to repair this damage.


This  machinery consumes NAD+ and energy molecules. Therefore, excessive DNA damage can drain valuable cellular resources.
Made in Australia
