             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Hylo-Comod Lubricating Eye Drops is indicated to improve the lubrication of the eye surface in eyes that are dry, burning or have foreign body sensations due to environmental conditions as well as after ophthalmosurgical interventions.
Hylo-Comod contains the sodium salt of hyaluronic acid, a natural substance that is found in the eye but also in other parts of the body. Due to its special physical property, it forms a regular, stable. long lasting lubricating moisture film on the ocular surface that is not easily rinsed off. It does, however, not cause blurred vision and protects the eyes from dryness and irritation for a long time.
This is particularly important if the user wears contact lenses, because the contact lens needs to swim in sufficient tear fluid in order not to cause any discomfort. Hylo-Comod may be used while wearing contact lenses. Wearing soft or hard contact lenses will be made more comfortable by using Hylo-Comod as it does not form crusts or deposits.
As Hylo-Comod is preservative-free, it is usually very well-tolerated. Additionally, Hylo-Comod is free of phosphates so that complications like deposits in the cornea are avoided.
Hylo-Comod has a 6 MONTHS  Shelf Life upon opening. Each bottle of 10ml is sufficient for about 300 drops.
Made in Germany
DIRECTIONS:
Hylo-Comod should be used according to the instructions given by doctor or contact lens specialist. Generally, instill 1 drop of Hylo-Comod 3 times a day into each eye. If necessary, it can also be used more frequently.
