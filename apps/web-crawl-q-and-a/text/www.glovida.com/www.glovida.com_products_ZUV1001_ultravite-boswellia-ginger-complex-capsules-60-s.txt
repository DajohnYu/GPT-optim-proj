Price is much cheaper here than in retail shops, especially if you manage to get it during their promotion period. csrick 2017-08-23  Ultravite Boswellia & ginger Purchased 2 boxes of Ultravite boswellia on friends recommendation. Been on it for 2 weeks so far so good, my knee use to give cracking sound/pain, now this symptoms reduced.
