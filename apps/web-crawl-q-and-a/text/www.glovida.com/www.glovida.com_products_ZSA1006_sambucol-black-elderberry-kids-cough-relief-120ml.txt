Effective when you give your child this once they start having symptoms of flu and cough. Ordering was smooth and easy with fast delivery too. Calise 2018-02-24  Non drowsy is a plus point Love this as it's non drowsy. Sambucol products generally taste good and my children take them without fuss. As usual, prompt delivery and good products from Glovida. FL 2017-09-08  good product I give this to my children when they have cough. Quite effective. Healthy Kids, Happy Mom 2017-07-17  Love the sambucol range I particularly like the sambucol cough version as it contains ivy leaf and elderberry, to soothe the cough and at the same time, boost the immunity. Great prices here on Glovida, especially with promo codes. 
Excellent service and very prompt replies. Sheila 2017-07-03  Good prices and excellent service I like to use natural remedies for my family's usual ailments and Sambucol is a product we all love and have found that it works very well to reduce the duration of the symptoms.
