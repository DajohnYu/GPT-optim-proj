Megan Behler 2021-06-08  love the variety of vivomixx probiotics available. been taking the sachets version of vivomixx. trying the capsules version. Eunjeong Park 2021-03-05  Great Daily Probiotics! I've started taking 1 sachet of Vivomixx per day 3 weeks ago due to frequent bloating and occasional abdominal pain. It has significantly reduced bloating since then and I no longer have abdominal pain - very satisfied with the product and will continue to take it.  Glovida's delivery service is superb. Within 1 day of the order, they contact to confirm the delivery date and time slot, then most importantly they do deliver during the time slot that they promised!  Chung Li Lian 2019-08-13  good quality This is a good quality probiotics. Very much more convenient to order it here. The items are always delivered promptly. Driver always call before delivery to make sure I am home.  Good service!   Related Products   PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.
