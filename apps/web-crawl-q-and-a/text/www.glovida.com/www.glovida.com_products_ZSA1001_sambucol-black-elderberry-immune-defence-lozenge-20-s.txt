 Cheryl 2017-05-27  One of the better tasting lozenges Took this when I kept coughing due to an itchy throat. Soothed it almost immediately. Plus its taste and texture is like a fruit gummy! Chris 2017-04-27  the tastiest Lozenges ever! and works very well to soothe my irritated throat.  Mimi 2017-01-17  Tasty the tastiest lozenges.  :)  and it works. nicole 2016-10-03  taste good! this taste really delicious. :p happymom 2016-08-31  Delicious lozenges? It's true! It does not taste medicinal but is just as soothing to the throat. I purchased the Black Elderberry version and simply love its tangy flavor. I like the fact that it has Vitamin C and is in the form of a 'gummy'.   Related Products   PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.
