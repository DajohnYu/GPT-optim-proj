             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  This intensive, fast-absorbing formula rejuvenates dull and tired skin to reveal a translucent and radiant complexion. The 3 superfruits - Kakadu Plum, Illawarra Plum and Burdekin Plum are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants, to liven up dull skin tones and strengthen the skin’s defence against environmental stressors. The natural AHA from Lime Pearl gently exfoliates for a brightened skin-smoothing complexion. Topped off with Niacinamide, Tranexamic Acid and Licorice, to further calm redness, brighten uneven skin tones and fade dark spots over time. 
Oil-free, silicone-free and fragrance-free, this potent formula is proven to be effective without chemically harsh whitening agents.
The fluid texture rejuvenates lacklustre skin to deliver a translucent youthful glow with persistent use.
KEY INGREDIENTS:
• Kakadu Plum: The Kakadu Plum is touted as the most concentrated natural source of Vitamin C on earth, containing an average of 55 times the Vitamin C found in oranges. Its superior brightening abilities effectively targets dullness and hyperpigmentation for a more radiant and even complexion. The Kakadu Plum is also an antioxidant powerhouse, which protects your skin against premature aging caused by environmental damage. 
• Illawarra Plum: The Illawarra Plum is packed with anthocyanins, a potent antioxidant that protects your skin from free radical damage and fights signs of ageing. 

• Burdekin Plum: In addition to high levels of Vitamin C and antioxidants, the Burdekin Plum is also rich in skin-balancing minerals such as Zinc, Magnesium, Calcium and Potassium. 
• Lim Pearl: Lime Pearl is a natural source of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs), which gently removes pore-clogging debris and promotes natural cell turnover, for a visibly clearer and smoother complexion.
• Niacinamide: Niacinamide is a long-time favorite ingredient of ours, due to its versatility and multiple benefits for skin. Not only does it brighten and prevent hyperpigmentation, it also minimises the appearance of pores, balances oil production and strengthens the skin barrier.
• Licorice Root: Licorice Root offers anti-inflammatory effects to soothe sensitive skin and reduce redness. It also helps to diffuse existing melanin in the skin and inhibits the production of melanin, which fades existing dark spots and prevents the formation of new ones.
• Tranexamic Acid & Alpha Arbutin: Tranexamic Acid is definitely one of the well-deserving IT ingredients of 2021. It is a gentle yet powerful amino acid clinically proven to reduce hyperpigmentation. It works well with Alpha Arbutin, another ingredient that diminishes the look of dark spots, sun-spots, discolouration and post-acne marks. Together, they are the perfect team to boost overall brightness of skin, all while being very gentle on skin.
Made in Taiwan
