• Help to fight cold and limit the risks of secondary infection by washing out nasal cavities.

DIRECTIONS: 
On first use, spray once to start the system. Gently insert the nozzle into the nostril. Spray briefly 1 to 2 times in each nostril. Let any excess solution flow out before wiping the nose.
For a deeper cleansing of nasal cavities:
1) Place the baby under 2 years old lying on his back or sitting up from the age of 2.
2) Baby's head tilted to the side, gently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril. 
3) Press the nozzle for approximately 2 seconds. Let any excess solution flow out of the other nostril then wipe the nose.
