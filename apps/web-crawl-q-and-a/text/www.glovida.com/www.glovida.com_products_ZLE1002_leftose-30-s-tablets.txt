Leftose was first introduced to us by our family doctor. We have been using it ever since and it really works very well to relieve a painful sore throat. Works every single time.  Mrs Tay 2017-07-27  Really helps with my sore throats Leftose is my go-to whenever I have any signs of an inflamed throat. Usually pop 2 to 3 tablets 3 times daily and I would be well quite quickly. Tablet is also small so it is easy to swallow. Sean K 2017-07-03  I have been taking Leftose for years I was first introduced to leftose by my GP. It works very well for my sore throats, reducing the pain and swelling very quickly. Appreciate the prompt service by Glovida as well.
