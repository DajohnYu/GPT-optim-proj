               ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Oxithion Sublingual Tablets is a supplement containing reduced L-Glutathione (100mg), a natural tripeptide. It is the most powerful endogenous anti-oxidant. Glutathione protects the body from oxidative stress, inflammation and toxins, thereby improving the body’s functional status. Oxidative stress causes damage to cellular macromolecules resulting in physiological aging and the degenerative processes that occur in age-related diseases. Glutathione supplementation helps to delay the aging and degenerative processes, thereby keeping the body healthy and youthful.
Many studies have shown Glutathione superior benefit in lightening and brightening complexions while simultaneously retarding free radical damage. It thus keeps skin youthful, supple and fair.
The innovative sublingual Oxithion Sublingual Tablets is formulated as fast dissolving sublingual tablets, with an innovative patented technology. L-Glutathione is thus rapidly absorbed through the mouth mucosa into the body without being metabolized and then inactivated by the liver. The sublingual absorption also ensures a series of important benefits to the effectiveness of the product: ease of administration even in people with difficulties in swallowing; high tolerability; increased bioavailability of the active ingredients.
BENEFITS: 

• Brightening for a radiant and luminous complexion
• Prevention or reduction of age-related or photo-induced dark spots on the skin
• Lightening of skin tone on the face and body
• Provides antioxidant protection against skin aging

 
Made in Italy
DIRECTIONS:
