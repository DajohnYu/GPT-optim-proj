             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Sterimar baby is recommended for daily cleansing of baby's nose.

Sterimar Baby is an isotonic filtered sea water solution, 100% natural and free from preservatives. It provides the beneficial properties of mineral salts and marine trace elements. With a specially designed nozzle and very gentle pressure and microfine spray, Sterimar Baby ensures gentle nasal rinsing and cleansing.
By clearing impurities and germ filled mucus from your baby’s nose, Sterimar Baby not only helps ensure your little one can breath naturally but also helps support the nose’s natural filtering function. This helps ensure it is working as effectively as possible as a first line of defense, helping to prevent infections and allergic reactions.
BENEFITS:
• Gently cleanse the nose and eliminate impurities (dust, fine pollution, mucus, allergens)
• Aids in natural breathing and bottle feeding.
• Stimulates the natural defenses of the nasal lining. 
• 100% Natural
• Safe to use in babies 0-3 years of age. 
Made in France
CONTENTS:
Sea water, purified water.
DIRECTIONS: 
1) Sterimar baby is recommended for daily cleansing of baby's nose. Prime the spray by briefly pressing the nozzle. Lay baby down on his/her side or sit up with baby's head tilted to one side.
2) Gently insert the nozzle into the nostril.
3) Press the nozzle briefly-let any excess solution run out before wiping the nose.
4) Repeat the operation in the other nostril.
5) Clean the nozzle with soapy water, rinse and dry.
Use 2 to 6 times a day or more if required in each nostril.

My baby hated it but he slept better because it relieved his stuffy nose.
