• Certified organic chamomile to brighten and bring out the natural highlights
BENEFITS:

DIRECTIONS:
Wet their heads a little using your hand, a small cup or a cloth, making sure water doesn’t trickle down the face. Take a pea-sized amount of GAIA Natural Baby Shampoo and gently lather it into their hair. Don’t rub vigorously!
Use your hand, the cup or cloth to rinse out the shampoo carefully.
Note*- It uses plant-based surfactants and therefore low foaming.
