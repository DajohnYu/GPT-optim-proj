Provides really quick relief when there is an allergic reaction with the itchy skin and red eyes. Glad to have found it here. Very reasonable prices especially when there is a promotion. Iris Desiree 2017-08-25  Very good! This is my default when I start having runny nose.  Very good because it's non-drowsy.   Jamie 2017-08-21  Life saver I always get sinus due to irritation from dust or change in temperature. Thank you to zyrtec, i don't have to worry about my day being ruined by my never ending runny nose  Xavier 2017-03-20  convenient! appreciate the convenience of being able to get this on a online site.
