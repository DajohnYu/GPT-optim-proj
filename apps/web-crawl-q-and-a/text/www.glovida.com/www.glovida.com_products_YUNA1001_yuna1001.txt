          Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker Natural Barrier Dosed Nasal Spray 800mg
          Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker Natural Barrier Dosed Nasal Spray 800mg  Brand: Nasaval   S$16.05 
                  vs. Retail Price:
                  S$16.05       ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Nasaval Cold & Flu helps the body to create a barrier against germs, makes you less likely to ‘catch a cold’. Airborne germs are the most common way to catch cold and viruses, particularly in crowded places. Using Nasaval Cold & Flu before exposure to a crowded area will make it much more difficult to pick up colds and germs, hence acting like an invisible mask.
Nasaval Cold & Flu is a natural nasal powder spray containing a blend of micronized cellulose, peppermint and wild garlic that delivers fast protection from airborne germs that are inhaled via the nose. By trapping, absorbing and neutralising air borne germs, Nasaval Cold & Flu stops the causes of infection rather than just treating the symptoms. Simply squeeze from the easy to use dispense bottle into each nostril will rapidly distribute fine powder throughout the upper nasal passages and sinuses and remain effective for several hours.
This product is non- drowsy and does not have any known side effects which is suitable for children from 3 years, adults, pregnant and breast-feeding women. 
BENEFITS:
• Shorten the duration and severity of cold and flu-like symptoms
• Scientifically proven to block airborne allergens and germs
• Starts to defend in 2 minutes
• Natural ingredients without any antihistamines, steroids, drugs or medicines
• Non- drowsy and without known side effects
• Suitable for vegans
Made in UK
INGREDIENTS:
HPMC 93%, Peppermint Powder 2%, European wild garlic powder 5%
DIRECTIONS:
Step 1: Blow your nose. 
Step 2: Remove cap and shake the bottle side to side. 
Step 3: Administer a test spray to gauge the pressure required for an ideal dose, which is a 10 to 15cm plume of powder. If you find the bottle too stiff to squeeze with one hand then use both hands (once you are used to taking Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker the test spray is no longer needed). 
Step 4: Place the nozzle of the bottle just inside the nose and apply 1 to 2 sprays into each nostril. Inhale gently while squeezing but do not inhale deeply. Step 5: Re-apply each time you blow your nose.
Apply 2 to 3 times per day to maintain an effective barrier or if symtops have already started, use Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker 3 times per day until symtoms disappear. If used concurrently with other nasal spray, Nasaval Cold & Flu Blocker should be re-applied afterwards to ensure that the barrier created is not disturbed.
Do not use this product if you are sensitive to cellulose, mint or garlic. Not suitable for children under 3 years old
