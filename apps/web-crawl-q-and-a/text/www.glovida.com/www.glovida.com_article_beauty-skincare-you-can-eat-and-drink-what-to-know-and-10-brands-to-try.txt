               Terms of Use Privacy Policy   Beauty skincare you can eat and drink? What to know and 10 brands to try  Skincare supplements and collagen drinks have been around for a while, but the edible beauty trend has only really taken off recently, with more and more brands jumping on the eat-your-skincare bandwagon, and consumers very ready to swallow the promises of glowing skin and lush locks brought on by imbibing supplements.

With the increasing obsession with wellness and health, and changes in lifestyle brought on by the pandemic, people are looking for new ways of helping their bodies (including their skin and hair) cope, and remain in optimum condition.
Interestingly, many of these beauty supplements are from skincare labels, rather than brands more traditionally known for vitamins.

Skincare and hair supplements, like health supplements, bring extra vitamins and minerals to the table, adding nutrients that may be missing from our diets.
They compress into tiny pills and easy-to-consume sachets various foods and ingredients that may be difficult for us to regularly add to our meals, with the aim of contributing to better health and improved looks, from the inside out.
The modern urbanite is cottoning on to the reality that a multi-pronged and holistic approach will help in bringing forth that million-dollar glow – this includes great skincare products, a regimented diet, facials and treatments, and beauty products you can eat.


They compress into tiny pills and easy-to-consume sachets various foods and ingredients that may be difficult for us to regularly add to our meals.


Of course, as with anything you put on your face or into your body, caution is advised. Read the ingredient labels carefully, make sure the products are safe and approved by the health authorities, and consult a doctor if you have health conditions.
Here are some beauty supplements to consider if you plan to eat your way to great skin and hair.
1. IDS SKINCARE LYCO-WHITE ULTRA, S$128 FOR 30 TABLETS

What it’s for: Brighter skin, UV protection and improved immunity.
Local cosmeceutical skincare brand IDS Skincare’s new and improved Lyco-White Ultra supplements boast an amped-up formula and new ingredients to deliver fairer, brighter and more evenly-toned skin.
The 1,500mg of white tomato extract in each tablet is equivalent to eating 187 medium-sized fresh tomatoes, and one pill a day promises to serve up better skin, UV protection and even improved immunity.

2. MIRIQA PROFESSIONAL HAIR NUTRITION SUPPLEMENT, S$125 FOR 60 TABLETS

What it’s for: Hair growth and hair loss reduction.
With a drug-free formula to bring the glory back to your crowning head of hair, this local brand uses botanicals and proteins such as saw palmetto berries, tocotrienol, tripeptide collagen and biotin to boost hair growth, increase hair thickness, improve hair strength and reduce hair loss with two capsules a day. The brand also has skincare supplements for better and brighter skin.
