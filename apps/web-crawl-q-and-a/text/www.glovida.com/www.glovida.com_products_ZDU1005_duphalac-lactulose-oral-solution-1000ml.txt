             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Duphalac oral solution offers relief from constipation for all the family. 
Duphalac oral solution contains a laxative called lactulose. Duphalac may contain small amounts of milk sugars (e.g. lactose), galactose, epilactose or fructose.
As a prebiotic substance, lactulose intensifies the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while Clostridium and Escherichia coli may be suppressed, leading to alleviation of constipation.
BENEFITS:
• Relieves chronic constipation
• Little absorption into body
• Suitable for long-term use
Made in Netherlands
DOSAGE/ DIRECTIONS:
Take Duphalac diluted or undiluted. Swallow the medicine quickly. Do not keep it in the mouth. Take the dosage preferably once a day at the same time. During treatment with laxatives, drink sufficient amounts of fluids (6 to 8 glasses).
Dosing in constipation or for stool softening: 
Starting dose [Maintenance dose]: 
Adults 10 - 45 ml [10 - 25 ml]; 
Children (7-14 years) 15 ml [10 -15 ml]; 
Children (1-6 years) 5 - 10 ml [5 - 10 ml]; 
Infants under 1 year Up to 5 ml [Up to 5 ml].
Based upon treatment response the doctor may adjust the starting dose to the maintenance dose after a few days. Several (2-3) days of treatment may be needed before treatment effect occurs.
Dosing in Portal systemic encephalopathy (PSE) (for adults only): 
Starting dose: 30 - 50 ml THREE times daily.
This dose may be adjusted by the doctor to the maintenance dose to achieve 2 to 3 soft stools per day.
