             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Evolve HA are soothing eye drops intended for use in the relief of discomfort that arises from dry eye sensations. They provide soothing relief for sore eyes from grit, itchiness and other foreign body irritations.
• Great for moderate to severe dry eyes.
• Preservative Free Multi-Dose bottle.
• Contact Lens Friendly. 
Dry eye sensations may also be produced by use of TVs and computer screens, infrequent blinking, certain medical treatments including refractive laser eye surgery, atmospheric pollution and drying atmosphere e.g. air conditioning, central heating, wind and sun. 
Evolve HA is a unique system designed to combine the benefits of unit dose preservative free eye drops with the convenience of a standard eye drop bottle. Once opened the bottle can be used for up to 3 months. 
Evolve HA is both preservative free and phosphate free, ideal for sensitive eyes and frequent users. 
Made in UK
DIRECTIONS:
Place one drop of Evolve HA into each eye two to four times a day or as directed by your doctor, pharmacist or optician. 
Evolve HA is compatible with all types of contact lenses.

Better than those 1 time use disposable eye drops Karen Kwa 2022-05-20  Great product Effective for dry and tired eyes.  Huey Huey 2021-06-14  Good & soothing eye drops Effective for super dry eyes. More economical, can keep longer with no preservative. Gerry Wong 2021-06-05  Really good eye drops Love this, especially since my eyes are prone to dryness post-lasik. Love that the formula is preservative-free and can be used for 3 mths after opening. Much more affordable than the single sticks and also a lot more environmentally friendly.
