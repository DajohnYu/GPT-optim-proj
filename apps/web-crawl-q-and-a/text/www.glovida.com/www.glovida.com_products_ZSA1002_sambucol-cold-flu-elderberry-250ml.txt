FL 2017-09-08  good product Have been taking for the family to boost immunity. Good and effective product. Will purchase more. Cheryl 2017-05-27  It works! Typically when I start getting a sore throat, it is probably a sign of cold and eventually my nose would get very runny/blocked which would last awhile. This time I took sambucol when I started getting a sore throat and surprisingly, my nose didn't act up!! Mrs Chew 2017-03-27  Stock this at home! I always have this handy at our home.  For the just-in-case... 
It works. Mrs Chong 2017-02-02  have this handy Me and my family are very susceptible to colds and flu.  This product from Sambucol is one that I have used and trust.  Glovida has them at a good price and I enjoy the free next day delivery service. Highly recommended for all families.
