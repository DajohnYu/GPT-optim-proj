Emilyn 2020-02-06  Love this sunscreen  I’ve used this one for a while and it keeps my sunspots from returning. Really love this brand and product!  Iris  2019-06-06  Very good daily sunscreen I always loved Heliocare SPF90 gel but I thought I wanted to try this for days when I was just staying at home (low spf).  This is just as good as the SPF90 and I love the dry touch. FL 2017-09-08  good product Like it.non sticky. But quite expensive  Xuan  2017-08-15  Great online store Have been using Heliocare sunscreen for years and I found that Glovida is selling cheaper than other dermatologist.

Absorbs quickly and it does not feel like you just put on a tub of grease on your face. Great SPF protection. Absorbs quickly and it does not feel like you just put on a tub of grease on your face. Mrs Wong 2017-05-05  My favourite sunscreen so far I was always switching brands prior to using the Heliocare 360 partly because many of the sunblocks result in clogged/oily pores. This has worked very well for me and I am a lot more confident that it protects me from getting freckles and age spots which are dreadful.  Sherry Choo 2017-03-21  great product! non-oily and light.  works very well for my skin.  great product! S. 2016-12-08  Best sunblock yet I love it! This has a very pleasant smell and feels light on my face. I dread sunblock that leaves me oily and makes me feel like I'm covered with gunk. Thumbs up Gywn 2016-10-21  My absolute favourite sunblock I love this! Much better than all the rest.
