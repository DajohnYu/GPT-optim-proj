Fast delivery and good price, especially during promotions. Improves children’s immunity and gut health. Isabel Tan 2022-01-26  Build immunity  Multiple purchases from Glovida as it’s cheaper with promo compared to outside. Love that it helps to build immunity and protects my kids gut health  Alicia Tan 2021-11-13  Great Value & Speedy Delivery Ordered this during the 11.11 sale and got a good deal for this. Best part was that the order was delivered the next day. Calise 2018-02-24  Protects gut health  Lactogg protects the gut health of my children esp when they are down with stomach flu and could not stomach anything. I bought a dozen at one go during 12.12 sale. My children are taking one per day. Builds up their immunity. Glovida never fails to call to arrange delivery time slot. Prompt and responsible! Lin 2017-11-10  Better deal Consider to be more expensive than other probiotics and managed to get from Glovida at a cheaper price. Got it for my baby for eczema (recommended by pd) and hopes in long run, it will improves his condition. Fiona 2017-11-09  Thumbs up! Good product especially in helping bowel movements for my toddler! Louisa 2017-08-20  Pricier than other probiotics This product is generally pricier than other probiotics I've tried. But it's like this across other places, and Glovida happens to sell them cheaper than pharmacies. I don't know if this probiotic is the best for me, but so far based on what I have tried, this one seems to work well for me, and I have noticed less occurrences of gastric pains when on this. The downside is that this probiotic needs to be refrigerated, so I tend to forget to take it as regularly as I hope to. I still hope price for this will go down across the board! Jan 2017-08-17  Excellent Product, Price & Personal Service! I have ordered this product from Glovida twice, because of its excellent service. The staff is kind and extremely efficient. The product is a must-have for young kids and prevents most stomach discomforts. The price is good especially when there are promotions such as Mother's Day or Anniversary Promotions!

Maybe can put expire date on the website.  Michelle 2017-07-16  Best quality probiotics out there Because of our busy schedule we hardly have time to make our own fermented products such as kefir. So our next best alternative is to source for a top quality probiotics to improve our gut health. Our family lives by this brand and have felt a difference to our bowel movements, and immunity. Lynda 2017-07-10  Very impressive service I was very impressed by the prompt service Glovida gave. The probiotics really arrived the very next day and the courier service came with a cooler bag. Very good pricing too, especially with 2 or more of the same product. Hope J 2017-07-02  Happy with product. Delivered very quickly  Happy with product.

You have  been most helpful.  I appreciate it greatly! :) J 2017-03-13  Still undecided if it's helping with my eczema. P.S. Great after sales service  I've been on lactogg for about 3 months or so now. Need more time to tell if it's benefitting me.  Will continue to take it for a few more months. 

p.s. 
I ordered a box of lactogg but received another brand's probiotic capsules. I emailed Glovida; they replied shortly after. 
They were apologetic and said that they'd self-deliver the correct item to me later that day. 
Rather fast delivery, great customer service.   Sabrina Tan 2017-03-13  I will definitely order again! It was a breeze ordering. The online chat was also easy to use. Delivery was very fast and good. I will definitely order again!    Related Products   PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.
