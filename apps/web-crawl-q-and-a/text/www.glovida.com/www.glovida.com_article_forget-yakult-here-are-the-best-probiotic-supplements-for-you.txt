               Terms of Use Privacy Policy   Forget Yakult! Here Are the Best Probiotic Supplements for You  For most of us, the very first exposure to probiotics is in the little yummy bottle of Yakult drink. That’s when we first learn about the good bacteria in the body and how having more of them is good for our digestive system and health.
We’ve come a long way since then. Now with probiotics being the latest buzz word in the world of health supplements, we see a myriad of probiotic products everywhere we go. You have probiotic drinks, cereal, coffee and more food and drinks claiming to be filled with healthy strains of probiotics. And of course, there’s Yakult - one of the most popular probiotic drink, isn’t it?
But do you really know what’s in your favourite morning drink? Turns out, a lot of questionable stuff that you don’t expect to find! According to health and fitness coach Alex Fergus, Yakult is filled with a dizzying amount of unhealthy sugar! It actually contains 10.2 grams of sucrose which translates to 2.5 teaspoons of pure sugar - this makes its sugar content greater than the amount found in coke per 100ml! In addition, it also consists of skim milk and other artificial sweeteners that are harmful to one’s body! So all you who’ve sworn-off drinking coke altogether, you might also have to rethink your Yakult consumption.
Given that Yakult’s no longer the best option, what are other probiotic alternatives? The answer is simple! PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENTS! Not only do they help boost a child’s growing immunity, it also strengthens one’s digestive system regardless of age! Continue to read on as our in-house pharmasist breaks down the best probiotic supplements that can help enhance your family's overall health:


PROBIOTICS FOR KIDS
LactoKids is a great tasting supplement that strengthens the line of defence against bad bacteria with its unique patented combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.

Nature’s Way Kids Probiotics Chocolate Balls is a fun and delicious supplement that helps to boost your child's probiotic intake. Each chocolate ball houses over 1 billion good bacteria like Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis that improves your child’s digestive health.

BioGaia is a chewable tablet that contains the natural Lactobacillus reuteri Protectis. In addition to promoting good bacteria in your child’s gut and restoring digestive balance, it also offers a great relief from stomach discomforts. It also comes in drops form which is suitable for infants!
