Really quick turnaround and great service from Glovida, price is very competitive as well compared to retail outlets. Yin Ling Leong 2022-12-11  Regular order This probiotic works well for me therefore I'm ordering it regularly Amanda Tee 2021-12-16  Regular orders for my parents I got my 60something year old parents started on probiotics. I wanted vivomixx for them because most doctors recommend it but it’s such a hassle to get it from hospitals or stores. Glovida is great in terms of pricing, customer relations and product assurance! I work in Japan at the moment and I’m so glad that I can order probiotics on behalf of my parents hassle free through glovida! Gloria Koh 2021-11-02  Vivomixx Probiotics Caps 30's This probiotics has been really helpful to ensuring a healthy gut. i experienced extreme bloating and it really helped to ease the bloating and been having healthy gut since i started on this 2 years ago. Yin Ling Leong 2021-06-14  effective so far had been having these for months and it works well for me Megan Behler 2021-06-08  been getting my regular supply here thank you for consistently delivering it to me so promptly each order.  love that i can use my points to exchange for vouchers to offset my purchase. Teresa Shiu 2020-10-13  Good for whole family Great live bacteria without the sugar content from usual probiotic drinks. Love buying here not only it's cheaper, but I don't need to worry about transporting vivomixx myself without cold bag.  Margaret 2020-04-11  It helps me to reduce my gastric problem.  It help me to reduce gastric problem. Huey  2018-11-16  Superb Product is effective and Glovida service is superb. I just purchased half an hour ago and i got msg from the delivery guy - to say that they will deliver it by today...Woah! Cold pack will be included for the probiotics -  maintain the viability. Victor 2018-03-11  Highly Effective Probiotic Product. Much Better Than Any Yogurt, Yakult and Vitagen A truly effective probiotic product that contains much higher levels of good bacteria when compared to any yogurt or probiotic drinks like Yakult or Vitagen. Also does not contain additional sugar content, which helps reduce risk of diabetes.

Everyone's immune system is within his very own digestive system. So, when you want to keep your body healthy, in addition to healthy eating and exercise habits, you have to keep your digestive system healthy as well by making sure the levels of good bacteria (which is not naturally produced in our bodies) in your gut is maintained daily.

Ever since taking Vivomixx, my digestion and bowel movement has greatly improved, and I am truly thankful that this has also helped me stay healthy, especially during the recent flu season a few months ago. A good sign that my immune system has strengthened as well. Calise 2018-02-24  Fantastic product A colleague recommended vivomixx to me as it helped her with her gastro problems. I have been taking one per day for 2 months now and it really makes a difference! No more constipation and moving bowels is a breeze! I no longer feel bloated after meals. I will be back for more. Glovida keeps their probiotics well chilled and ensures they deliver it that way too. Thumbs up!  VL 2018-01-15  Good Product Good Product. Helps keep my digestive system working properly. Jeslyn 2017-09-06  GREAT PRODUCT Tried this product after reading the reviews. Been suffering from constipation since young and occasionally indigestion. Today is the 3rd day i been taking, so far smooth bowel movement. Thumbs up! Will take this for long term.  Lily  2017-08-31  Very nice product Thanks to Glovida for sending this probiotic with ice pack. Price is cheaper than pharmacy outside, surely will purchase from u again :)  Seah 2017-07-17  Effective Have IBS since young.  Was quite skeptical when I was introduced to this product by a pharmacist.. 
tried it since April this year..    
Bloatedness much reduced & most of the time, don't give too much of problem whenever I take it. 
But Once I stop, it's back to normal. 
Guess lifestyle & diet plays a part too.
-Will Continue taking to maintain my gut health.. 

Price also lower than those at retail store (if no promotion going on.)

Happy to discover this product :) Sarah 2017-06-20  Great product       I had digestive issues after 2 rounds of antibiotics. Bloating, gas , tummy aches. But one capsule of this every morning took care of it. I no longer wake up to stomachaches, or uncomfortable gas after lunch, this has also normalized my bowel patterns. 5 stars. I will repurchase and take it  for as long as I need to. Will definitely bring this overseas when I travel too. Thank God for this as it gave me great relief from all these uncomfortable stomach problems. 3 cheers!  Jerry 2017-03-21  I'm impressed Impressed with the excellent service.  My questions were answered promptly and goods were delivered the very next day.  Glovida's team delivered it personally to ensure quality control.  Keep up the good work! Jolyn 2017-01-17  Great product at a great price! Much cheaper at Glovida especially when there's no promotion at retail stores. Great delivery service too. Small ice pack included to ensure the product is kept at the right temperature. wan 2017-01-14  Very effective product I have been taking vivomaxx since mid 2015. It was known as vs#3 then. I think it helps intestinal problem like bowel disorder or ibs-like problems. Was recommended by my gastroenterologist. Glovida not only sells vivomaxx cheaper than other pharmacies, it provides very good service. The probiotics which contain live bacteria was personally couriered to ensure its quality not compromised. I would definitely buy from Glovida again.  gordon 2017-01-09  quick and reliable my supply ran low and I didn't have time to go to my regular pharmacy to buy. did a google search and glovida came out.  decided to try and was pleasantly surprised at the swift delivery.  (I ordered in the morning and got the items the very next working day!).  and it's at a lower price than I usually paid too. I checked the item thoroughly when it arrived.  totally authentic too!  
I'll be back. :) june 2016-10-31  good price I buy this regularly from the local pharmacy.  
better price here!  please keep the competitive prices.  leo 2016-09-30  great, this is my favourite probiotics brand. Bel75 2016-08-31  Glad you stock this Thanks for answering my query on the storage facilities. Was assuring to know you stock your probiotics in air-conditioned warehouses. The pharmacist recommended this and I have been taking this regularly for gut health. Works better for me than the other brands somehow.
