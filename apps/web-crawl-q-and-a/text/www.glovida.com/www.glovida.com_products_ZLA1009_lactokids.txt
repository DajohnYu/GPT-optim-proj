Jac Phua 2022-03-12  convenient and easy helps to move the bowel along easily and maintain good gut health. easy and convenient to feed them Siti Zaidan 2021-08-03  Very effective Delicious taste ROY S 2021-06-24  A complete children probiotics that works! There is nothing more important than good health for kids. Lactokids is one of the very few probiotics that has added vitamins B's, D, colostrum, calcium, prebiotics for the growth of a child. My 2 daughters take Lactokids daily, they rarely fall sick, ease of answering the call and can see probiotics working very well for them for digestion and immunity. Especially in these times, staying strong and healthy is so important.  Celia Toh  2021-06-22  the pharmacist recommended this! I was looking for a probiotic for my kids and the pharmacist recommended this - it helped ease my children's stomach discomfort.  and it's tasty for them to want to take.  I am also buying the adult version for myself. Geraldine  Lim 2021-06-05  Probiotics that my children really love. and works! I have tried all kinds of probiotics from capsules, to tablets and sachets. I find Lactokids really convenient as they require no refrigeration. And if my children complain of a slight tummyache, I can just pop a few sachets in their school bag (just in case their tummy acts up in school). Best thing is, the product really works and tastes so good, it isn't hard to get the kids to take them! cindy 2020-07-19  Kids have been taking this for a long time I first saw this brand of probiotics at the shops and have been buying them for my kids. They’ve been taking them for more than a year! Value for money! Peggy 2019-01-30  my kids love it! this tastes so great. my kids love them. and kept asking for it everyday. Mabel 2018-08-31  Good probiotics for my twins I am glad that I am able to get this probiotics from Glovida. My GP always prescribe this brand for my twins when they have digestive issues. I can see that my twins’ bowel system improves a lot after consuming for 2 weeks plus.
