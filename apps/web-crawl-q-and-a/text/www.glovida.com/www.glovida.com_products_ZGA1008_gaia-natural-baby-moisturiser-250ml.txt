• Organic avocado oil nourishes even the driest skin.
• Organic sweet orange gently cleanses the nappy area to keep their bums clean and fresh.
• Organic shea butter is easily absorbed into the skin to create a smooth and soft barrier that seals in moisture for the softest skin.
• Cruelty-Free 
Made in Australia
SUGGESTED USES:
• Add a little water and lightly massage to calm your baby before bedtime 
• Doubles as the perfect belly moisturiser during pregnancy.
