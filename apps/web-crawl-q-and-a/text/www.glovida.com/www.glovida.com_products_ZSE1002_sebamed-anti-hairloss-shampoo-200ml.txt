             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Sebamed Anti-Hairloss Shampoo reduces hair loss by activating the functions of the scalp and promoting efficient skin circulation to strengthen hair roots. Created with the same pH 5.5 value of healthy skin, Sebamed Anti-Hairloss Shampoo protects the natural barrier function of the skin’s acid mantle, stabilising the hair structure to make it less vulnerable to dryness, splice and breakage to maintain strong, shiny hair.
BENEFITS:
• 100% Soap and Alkali-free
• For all hair types
• Without colour additives
• The pH 5.5 promotes the natural barrier function of the scalp's acid mantle and helps to protect the hair's structure.
• The efficacy of Anti-Hairloss Shampoo is based on the NHE formula plus caffeine and gingko biloba for a medicinal activation of the scalp. Thanks to this stimulation of the blood circulation, there is an increase in the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the papilla and follicle
• Provides optimal growth conditions for strong and healthy hair
• Continuous application over several months will lead to visible results: reduced hair loss and healthier hair.
Made in Germany
