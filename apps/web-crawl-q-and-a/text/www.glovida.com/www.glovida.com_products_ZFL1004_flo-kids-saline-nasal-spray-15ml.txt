          Flo Kids Saline Nasal Spray 15ml

             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Flo Kids is an isotonic saline solution with added minerals. It helps clear a child’s runny or blocked nose quickly, gently and easily. It delivers a gentle, non-medicated, preservative-free nasal saline that is suitable for daily use.
Using Flo Kids can help relieve a kid’s nasal symptoms due to COLDS and ALLERGIES because it can:
• Wash away mucus including excessive mucus produced by colds, pollens, dust and other allergy-causing particles
• Help remove mucus plugs in the nose.
• Moisturise nasal tissues.
• Help prevent scabbing in the nose. 
Flo Kids Saline can be used at any angle, making it quick & easy to clear your child's nose. Flo Kids Saline is ideal for kids. The thumb drive pump is easy to use - some children can even do it themselves! Always make sure it is under parental supervision. Children who are involved in their own treatment are often happier and more co-operative, making them easier to treat.
Made in Germany
DIRECTIONS: 
1) Get your child to sit or stand in a comfortable position.

3) Wipe their nose with a soft clean tissue (or get them to do themselves!).
4) All Flo Kids packs include a Consumer Information Leaflet giving detailed instructions and further information.
DOSAGE: 
Children 0 to 2 years: insert up to 2 sprays per nostril. 
Children 2 years to 6 years: Insert up to 3 sprays per nostril.
