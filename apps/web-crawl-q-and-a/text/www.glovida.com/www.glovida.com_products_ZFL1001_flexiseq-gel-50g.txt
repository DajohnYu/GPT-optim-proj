Flexiseq worked in reducing knee pain but need to be applied long term which raised issue of affordability versus an injection of synovial fluid. If Flexiseq is priced lower it will definitely be a viable alternative to synovial injection.  Benjamin 2019-03-07  Recommended This is a good topical application for joints.
