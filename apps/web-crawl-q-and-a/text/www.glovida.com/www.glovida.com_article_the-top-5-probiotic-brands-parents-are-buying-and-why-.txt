               Terms of Use Privacy Policy   The Top 5 Probiotic Brands Parents are Buying and Why?  Why is everyone talking about probiotics and what does it do for your body?
Scientific evidence has shown a strong correlation between probiotics and the gut health of young children. Probiotics play a crucial role in regulating one’s digestion and intestinal function.
We’ve gathered some valuable insights from parents and trusted pharmacists to create a guide on what probiotics are, their benefits for your child and the top 5 brands that are popular among parents:
WHAT ARE PROBIOTICS?
There are some bacteria that reside in our gut which help carry out many of our gut functions and these are what we call “probiotics”. You can think of them as “good bacteria” that’s helping you maintain good balance in your body!
3 WAYS PROBIOTICS ARE HELPFUL TO YOUR CHILD’S HEALTH
Probiotics have a lot of benefits to the health of your child. Let us look at 3 major benefits of probiotics:

Probiotics help balance the good bacteria in your child’s digestive system
Probiotics can boost your child’s immune system
It may reduce the severity of certain allergies and eczema

PROBIOTICS IS SUITABLE FOR:

Preventing and treating diarrhoea/ constipation
Traveling: Prevent travellers’ diarrhoea (prophylaxis)
Children who don't take enough fibre
Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea

Taking antibiotics can cause gut imbalance, which can lead to diarrhoea, especially in children. Numerous studies have shown that taking probiotics at the same time as antibiotics can reduce the risk of diarrhoea by more than 50%. However, it is important to take antibiotics and probiotics a few hours apart, to prevent the probiotics from being killed by antibiotics if taken together. Probiotics can also be taken after a course of antibiotics to restore some of the healthy bacteria in the intestines.
THE TOP 5 PROBIOTIC BRANDS PARENTS ARE BUYING
We recommend parents to only buy probiotics from reputable stores. Also, obvious as it may seem, do review storage requirements of the probiotics brand, and to always remember to check the expiry dates before purchase.
