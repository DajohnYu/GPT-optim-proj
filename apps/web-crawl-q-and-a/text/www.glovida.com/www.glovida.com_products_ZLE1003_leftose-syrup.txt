Highly recommended. Speed delivery Elizabeth Lim 2021-06-15  A staple at home Been using Leftose for many years already. My mom loves the tablets as it helps her clear the phlegms especially with night coughs and my kids love Leftose because it tastes good (not too sweet, and without those artificial tastes that many cough syrups have). Works well every single time. Tasha Lee 2021-06-08  very good natural product thank you for the sample of Leftose Syrup! after trying the bottle that you guys gave, I bought another 3 bottles to stock at home.  cos it really helps to expel phlegm and works not just for kids but for adults too.  Shannia 2019-10-22  love the stickers inside! Such a nice touch. And made the kids so happy!
I am tempted to buy more just for the stickers. hahah.
and of course, the syrup worked really well and help the kids with their cough; they were able to cough the phlegm out and recovered speedily! Charmaine  2019-06-12  Thanks for stocking this!!
