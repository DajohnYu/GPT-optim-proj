David 2017-06-26  Saved Money This product works well to keep my thinning hair a little thicker. Better priced at GLOVIDA Tze Ting 2017-06-26  My Favourite This conditioner was recommended to me by my Aveda salon a couple of years ago. I am still using it because it made a noticable difference in the shine and perceived thickness of my hair. This has made quite an improvement. Lindy 2017-04-03  Can you have this in the bigger size too? That would really be added convenience and value. :) Zwendy 2016-11-14  Yea! Been searching online for better prices.  Quite challenging to find aveda products online. Glad you stock this. Price is pretty good.
