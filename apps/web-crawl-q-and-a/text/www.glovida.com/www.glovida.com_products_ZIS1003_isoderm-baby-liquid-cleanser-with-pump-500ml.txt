                       Oh no! Looks like we ran out of this product. Do register to get notified once we've stocked up!  Notify Me Product Details Description  Isoderm’s doctor recommended liquid baby cleanser now comes with a pump! Isoderm Baby Liquid Cleanser with Pump 500ml is a soap-free, non-alkaline cleanser that contains chamomile extract. Aside from its moisturising capabilities, this baby cleanser also protects babies’ skin from free radicals. It deeply moisturises so your baby’s skin becomes softer after every wash. Additionally, it builds up the skin’s biological protective acidic mantle so your baby gets powerful protection from bacterial infections. Works well with all skin types, especially dry and sensitive skin.
BENEFITS:
• Offers thorough skin moisturisation.
• Powerfully protects the babies’ skin from free radical damage.
• Builds the skin’s natural defenses against a variety of bacterial infection.
• Provides optimum protection to the skin by building its biological protective acidic mantle.
Made in Germany
DIRECTIONS: 
Rinse skin with water, lather Isoderm Liquid Cleanser and apply to face and body, then rinse. Use twice daily.

Philip Khoo 2017-03-27  This is a good quality product I usually buy multiples to make sure that there is always stocked up at home. gertrude 2016-12-27  good product this is a good product.  my kids have sensitive skin and it is very stressful for me whenever the eczema acts up.  (the humid weather here doesnt help too).  i have tried many products.  and this was recommended by the doctor when we visited the clinic.  I didnt have a chance to go back to the clinic to buy it (too busy taking care of the kids' activities!).  so I did a search and found it here.  now i get my regular supply from a trustworthy source.  thank you Glovida.   mama may 2016-12-13  great for my twins i buy this for my twins.  it's great.  love the home delivery service too.   Yee55 2016-10-21  My family has been using this for years and years... I have been finding it quite hard to find it at the pharmacies, and was very glad to have found it here. Given that we use it so regularly, price better be cheap!! Thanks!   Related Products   PURVEYOR OF HEALTH & BEAUTY About Glovida Articles Terms of Use Privacy Policy GET REWARDED.
