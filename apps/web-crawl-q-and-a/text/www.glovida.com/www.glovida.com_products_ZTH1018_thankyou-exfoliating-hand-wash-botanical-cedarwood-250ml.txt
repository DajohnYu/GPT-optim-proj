Notify Me Product Details Description  REFINING - This hand wash is a complete sensorial experience that helps your mind feel balanced, and your hands to feel super soft, soothed, and hydrated! To give you clean, refreshed hands that smell ah-mazing, we’ve put the good stuff in, like the calming, woody aroma of botanical cedarwood. For a natural exfoliation, we’ve used finely milled pumice that’s gentle on skin, as well as aloe vera leaf juice and chamomile extract.

DIRECTIONS:
With a pump of wash and a little water, rub your hands together and massage well for exfoliation, or lather lightly for a gentler clean. Rinse off, pat dry and walk away counting down the minutes until you get to wash your hands again.
