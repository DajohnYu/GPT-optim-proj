             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  For a daily boost that's tastier, give your child this blend of Cod Liver Oil, Vitamin A, Vitamin D and Calcium, with the added goodness of orange flavour. Vitamin A supports normal immune function and healthy vision. Vitamin D helps to maintain healthy bones and teeth; and supports normal immune function. Calcium is beneficial for strong bones and teeth.
What's more, Scott's Emulsion is pre-emulsified, which means the Cod Liver Oil in it is broken down and suspended in the product as tiny droplets. This is closer to the way our body naturally digests oils.
Taken daily, the nutrients in Scott's Emulsion Orange help you support your child's immune system and healthy growth as well as development everyday.
