Germaine  2017-07-04  This rescued me from the crazy hair loss I had post pregnancy!! I was extremely distressed post-pregnancy as my hair kept falling off in clumps. Pretty depressing to pick up so much hair at the shower, and in the bedroom where i blow dry my hair. Was introduced to Aveda Invati by my hair stylist and truly, my hair loss was reduced to a minimal after use. It helps to have this here at Glovida at a better pricing, given that this shampoo isn't cheap! Great service and packaging by the way.  Vicki 2017-06-26  Great Product The package came through perfect, timely and the product really makes a big difference with my hair. Ernest 2017-06-26  Wow..... Great product, Love it Wow.....
