             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Fess Original Saline Spray 30ml is part of the Fess’s line of nasal sprays. It’s a non medicated saline nasal spray that clears the sinus by breaking down the mucus structure to relieve congestion and offering fast and effective relief from allergies, especially during bouts of sinusitis, hay fever, and colds. 
This spray keeps the nasal passages moist and free from allergens by washing away dirt and dust build up. What’s more, it’s suitable for pregnant and lactating women. To use, just directly depress the pump of the nozzle into your right nostril then follow immediately on your left nostril.
BENEFITS:
• Naturally relieves congestion by thinning and clearing excess mucus.
• Protects from dust and other pollutants, especially allergens that cause hay fever.
• Promotes and strengthens nasal health by neutralising the acidity in the sinus cavity.
• Softens dried blood for post-operative care so as not to irritate sinus passages.
• Suitable for use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
Made in Australia
DIRECTIONS: 
Adults: 2-6 sprays per nostril. 
Children: 2 to 3 sprays per nostril or use FESS Children's. Babies: use FESS Little Noses.
Direct the nozzle into your right nostril. Aim slightly back and out towards the top of your right ear. Fully depress the pump. Repeat in the left nostril.

I usually stock up whenever I travel to Australia or get friends to buy for me. I didn't realize that I have run out of stock while packing for my upcoming trip. Did a quick search online and found that you guys sell it! Was so happy and even happier with the next day delivery!!! Thank you and great job on your industry knowledge and resourcefulness!  Georgia 2019-09-24  stock up on this! I always lug this back when I travel to Australia! This works very well for my sensitive nose and allergies.  So glad that now I can just buy online and the delivery was so fast! Thank you. I will be back for more.
