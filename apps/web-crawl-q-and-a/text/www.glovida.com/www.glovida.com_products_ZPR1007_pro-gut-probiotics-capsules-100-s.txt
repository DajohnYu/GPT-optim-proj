             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Pro-Gut is an oral probiotic to promote a healthy balance of digestive flora. Pro-Gut is a synbiotic: a combination of probiotics and prebiotics. 
Probiotics are live non-harmful bacteria that, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a beneficial effect to the health of the host. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that benefits the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species that can support the health of the host. For instance, prebiotics can be beneficial to probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.
Each Pro-Gut capsule contains a minimum of  9 billionlive bacteria from a unique blend of 8 different 
 probiotic strains that are characteristic of a healthy normal human gut microflora, and include strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. To ensure the survival of these bacteria during the journey through the stomach, Pro-Gut is micro-encapsulated. In addition, the prebiotic inulin is included to stimulate the growth of friendly and healthy intestinal bacteria which supports good colon health.
BENEFITS:
• Effective for diarrhoea, IBS & other gut disturbances.
• Micro-encapsulation technology to ensure the survival of the good bacteria.
• 100% Natural Synbiotic
• Vegetarian capsule

1. Lactobacillus Acidophilus - 2.25 billion
2. Lactobacillus Casei - 2.25 billion
3. Lactobacillus Lactis - 2.1 billion
4. Lactobacillus Bulgaricus - 75 million
5. Bifidobacterium Infantis - 1.5 billion
