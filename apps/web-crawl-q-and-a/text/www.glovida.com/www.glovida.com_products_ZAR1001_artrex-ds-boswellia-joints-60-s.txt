Nura 2018-12-28  A Good Natural Supplement for Joint Problems Artrex DS is a good natural supplement for joint problems. I did not experience any side effects when I took Artrex DS tablets but this experience may differ with different users. Overall, it had reduced my knee pain. 

The price of this supplement on Glovida is much cheaper than at the usual big Pharmacies and Hospitals. Glovida is a fuss-free online purchase site and it provided fast delivery.  Mee Fong 2018-01-24  Good for joints Thank you very much for bringing in this product.  I will order from you.  Buying it from the pharmacy or doctor is definitely more expensive. This is a natural supplement especially for promoting healthy joints.  Thank you once again !!!! Linda 2017-08-24  Very good price, and prompt delivery Product came nicely packed with long expiry dates.
