The unique 3-in-1 formulation works simultaneously to improve the appearance of existing acne scars, dark marks as well as prevent acne reoccurrence. It also heals wounds naturally while fading dark spots and/or brown marks.

• Helps to prevent acne re-occurrences
• Suitable for oily and acne prone skin
• Quick absorbing, Non-greasy 
• Non-comedogenic. Hypoallergenic. Alcohol Free.
With continuous and recommended usage, the appearance of acne scars will be less visible:
• 4 weeks of continuous treatment is suggested for any dark spots and redness.
• More than 4-8 weeks continual treatment is suggested for depressed acne scars.
• To prevent acne from developing into scars, once the acne appears less inflamed, apply Hiruscar Post Acne gel continuous for 4 weeks.
• Continuous treatment can also help prevent acne re-occurrences. 
*INDIVIDUAL RESULTS MAY VARY
