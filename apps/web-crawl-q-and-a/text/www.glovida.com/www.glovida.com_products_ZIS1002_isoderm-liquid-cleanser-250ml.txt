I find that prolonged use of it really makes the skin a lot better, smoother and less dry. I haven't used any other brands ever since I found Isoderm. I usually use the 500ml pump, but this smaller size comes in handy for travels. especially to cold climates where the skin becomes even more dry and my kids dont take well to the dry hotel soaps. Patrick 2016-11-14  Was finding it hard to find this outside Finally found it here. Very good price too. My family has been using this for years.  Lindy 2016-10-21  By far, my most favourite body cleanser I honestly swear by this product. It is REALLY GOOD. Leaves a super nice moisturized feel after a bath and my skin has really improved over years of using this.
