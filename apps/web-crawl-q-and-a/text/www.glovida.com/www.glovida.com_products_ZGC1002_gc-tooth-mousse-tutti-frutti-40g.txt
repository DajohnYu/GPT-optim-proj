             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  GC Tooth Mousse is used to provide extra protection for teeth, to help neutralise acid challenges from acidogenic bacteria in plaque and other internal and external acid sources.
GC Tooth Mousse is a delicious tasting, water based, sugar free crème that is beneficial for teeth. It contains calcium and phosphate; the major minerals teeth are made from. Because calcium and phosphate are carried in a special milk-derived protein called Recaldent (CPP-ACP), they are available in a soluble form. This means GC Tooth Mousse provides extra protection for teeth, buffers dental plaque acid from bacteria in the mouth and also protects teeth from acidic foods and drinks.
GC Tooth Mousse, the first product for professional use to contain this complex of CPP-ACP (Recaldent), is the ideal delivery system for bio-available calcium and phosphate ions. Tooth Mousse is not toothpaste. It is made of milk products so swallowing the product is safe and it can be used throughout the day. However, because Tooth Mousse is derived from milk protein (casein) it is not suitable for people who have a suspected or proven allergy to milk proteins.
