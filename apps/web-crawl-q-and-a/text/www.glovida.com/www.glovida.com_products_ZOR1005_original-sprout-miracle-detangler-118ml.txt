Notify Me Product Details Description  Original Sprout's professional quality Miracle Detangler makes combing easy for the whole family! Perfect for baby,  toddlers, children, and anyone with long hair. Use with a wide-tooth comb or vent brush. The best way to detangle is to start at the bottom in small sections and work your way up to the scalp. Be gentle as hair is most fragile when wet.

Restores moisture without a waxy or greasy residue. Helps strengthen all hair types including delicate and chemically treated, breakage prone Sprouts. Makes combing effortless.

• Gentle pH of 4.5 – 5.5
• For baby, toddlers, children and adults
• Key ingredients: calendula and rosemary
• For all hair types and textures
• Makes it easier to brush through tangles and helps prevent breakage
