          Omical 60’s – Organic Milk Calcium Tablets
          Omical 60’s – Organic Milk Calcium Tablets  (2) Brand: Omical  S$31.90 
                  vs. Retail Price:
                  S$31.90       ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Sourced from organic milk, Omical puts all the calcium goodness from milk, into an easy to swallow, absolutely absorbable, little tablet! It is also the ideal calcium supplement for pregnant mummies and their baby!
Each Omical tablet contains 250mg of calcium with added Vitamin D3 to help the body absorb the calcium better. Depending on your daily recommended calcium intake, you can easily meet the recommended amount with Omical. Calcium is better absorbed when taken in small amounts throughout the day, hence, taking 2 Omical tablets at a go is ideal.
Omical does not contain Calcium Carbonate, which may be sourced from non-food sources, such as rocks and shells. Omical is also free from toxic metals, such as arsenic, lead and mercury, making us the choice calcium supplements for you and your family.
HOW IT WORKS:
Sourced from milk, each milk-mineral tablet provides your body with 250mg of Elemental Calcium and 200 IU of Vitamin D3. Vitamin D is essential for calcium to be effectively absorbed into our bones and teeth.
Made in Canada
DOSAGES:
Intake is not dependent on food, can be taken any time of the day. Take 2 tablets 1 to 2 times a day, or as directed by your physician.
