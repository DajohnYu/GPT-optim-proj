             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Flo Baby Saline Nasal Spray helps clear a baby‘s runny or blocked nose quickly, gently and easily. Flo Baby Saline offers advanced technology to deliver a sterile, preservative-free, non-medicated, non-sting nasal saline for babies and toddlers. Suitable for daily use.
Using Flo Baby can help relieve a baby’s nasal symptoms due to COLDS and ALLERGIES because it can:
• Wash away mucus including excessive mucus produced by colds, pollens, dust and other allergy-causing particles.
• Help remove mucus plugs in the nose.
• Moisturise nasal tissues.
• Help prevent scabbing in the nose. 
Flo Baby has been designed with parents and carers in mind to! It is really easy and quick and only takes a few seconds to use – very useful when it comes to wriggly newborns and fidgety toddlers! Parents rate Flo Baby because it can be used at any angle repetitively (without the need for priming with each dose).  Look for SPRAYS AT ANY ANGLE clearly marked on Flo Baby packaging.
Baby sleep, feeding and settling tip:
If your baby has a blocked, runny or snuffly nose, try Flo Baby 10 minutes BEFORE feeding, play and sleep time. This helps thin and clear mucus to enable easier breathing. Easier breathing means your baby may sleep and feed easier too!
Made in Germany
