YourGutPlus+ is the ideal 3-in-1 prebiotic with probiotic and vitamin D3 supplement for good gut health and immunity. It contains a special mix of 5 different, scientifically-selected butyrate enhancing lactobacillus probiotic bacteria, and is supported by an effective prebiotic.
Each capsule contains 10 times the amount of natural bacteria as a large yogurt. It is also supported by an effective prebiotic soluble fibre, inulin which aids the gut microbiome. There’s no recommended amount of probiotics one should consume daily. Most numbers vary from 1 to 10 billion that you can consume once or twice daily. A lack of probiotics might hinder your progress. However, this doesn’t mean consuming more is the best option.
The vegetable-based slow-release capsules are designed to dissolve later, and bypass the stomach to the gut, withstanding stomach acids, where the healthy bacteria can perform its functions. This allows the probiotics inside to be unaffected b other substances.
Exposure to the stomach acids will result in the probiotics being destroyed and not establishing itself in the gastrointestinal tract, which will render consuming YourgutPlus+ ineffective.
YourgutPlus+ contains multi-strain, scientifically tested, lactobacillus probiotics which are non-dairy. These help to break down healthy foods and nourish the gut lining cells, maintaining a healthy gut wall.
BENEFITS:
• Scientifically selected for the national Phyto-V nutritional intervention study
• Patented delayed release vegan capsule – bacteria get to where they are most needed. 100% Natural, lactose, gluten and artificial chemical free
• Multi-strain clinically proven lactobacillus probiotics which help to break down healthy foods and feed the gut lining cells maintaining gut wall integrity• 10 Billion colony forming units (CFU) per day (10 times the CFU of an average live yogurt) which improve the diversity of gut flora
• Vitamin D3 enhancement and bioactivation – Contains more than enough of the RDA so you do not have to take extra vitamin D supplements.  Vitamin D combined with probiotics is known to greatly improve  absorption, bioavailability and healthy functions of vitamin D
