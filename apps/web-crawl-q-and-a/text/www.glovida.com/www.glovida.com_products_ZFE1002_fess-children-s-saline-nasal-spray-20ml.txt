             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  The powerful nasal spray from Fess just got even better with its best formulation made especially for kids aged 2 to 10 years old! Fess Children’s Saline Nasal Spray is a non medicated nasal spray that offers a natural way to relieve kids’ blocked nose. 
It is made from micro-filtered seawater and relieves sinus and nasal congestion brought on by allergies, colds, and sinusitis. It effectively manages children’s allergies by stimulating the nose’s natural defences and calming sinus and nasal cavity inflammation by breaking down the mucus. Finally, this product helps wash away dust, pollen, and other allergens. 
Fess Children’s Saline Nasal Spray is safe and free from preservatives and harmful chemicals, promoting better nasal health for kids!  
BENEFITS:
• Naturally relieves congestion by thinning and clearing excess mucus.
• Protects from dust and other pollutants, especially allergens that cause hay fever.
• Promotes and strengthens nasal health by neutralising the acidity in the sinus cavity.
• Softens dried blood for post-operative care so as not to irritate sinus passages. 
Made in France
DIRECTIONS: 
Use 2-3 sprays per nostril as needed. 
Direct the nozzle into the right nostril. 
Angle the nozzle away from the centre of the nose pointing towards the right ear. 
Press the spray pump 2 or 3 times. 
Repeat in the left nostril.
