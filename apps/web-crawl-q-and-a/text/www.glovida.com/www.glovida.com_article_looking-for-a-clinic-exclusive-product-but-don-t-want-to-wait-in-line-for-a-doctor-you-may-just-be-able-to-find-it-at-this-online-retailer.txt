               Terms of Use Privacy Policy   Looking for a clinic-exclusive product but don't want to wait in line for a doctor? You may just be able to find it at this online retailer  The most effective beauty and wellness products are often the ones recommended by doctors and typically only stocked at clinics.
Just think about the eczema-moisturisers that your family doctor advise you to get or the skin-brightening supplements that your dermatologist offers as a solution to hyperpigmentation.
You’ve used these products and know that they work. But when it comes to replenishing them, you dread it.

That’s because you probably need to secure an appointment at the clinic, go through a review with the doctor, and then purchase the products while paying for a consultation fee.
We already feel the dreadful fuss just by typing the previous sentence.
Here’s a life hack you probably don’t know yet: you can actually get clinic-exclusive products without seeing a doctor - if you know exactly where to look!
Where to get clinic-exclusive products
You may think that you need to get a prescription to purchase clinic-exclusive products such as eczema treatment cream and beauty supplements, guess what - you don’t!
These products, while highly recommended by doctors, aren’t considered prescription medication, and are allowed to be bought off the shelves, even though they are commonly stocked at clinics because of how often medical professionals tell their patients to use them.
But we’ve come across a gem that stocks clinic-exclusive products online.

We’re talking about Glovida, an online health and beauty retailer that has been doing so for the last six years.
Glovida may have only been set up in 2016, but it is supported by a parent company that is recognised as an expert in the pharmaceutical industry and has been in this business for almost 50 years.
This is why Glovida understands the market and is able to bring in clinic-exclusive products that are 100% authentic.
Thanks to its established relationship with many brand owners, Glovida is able to stock these products at affordable prices too.
Supplements are also replenished regularly due to high demand so that you’d be sure that you’re getting the freshest stocks. In fact, the expiry dates are clearly indicated for all products listed, so you can have a peace of mind when you make a purchase.
For those who still require an expert’s input, Glovida’s in-house pharmacists can provide advice over WhatsApp messages - super convenient!
And if we can’t emphasise enough on convenience, Glovida also offers free next-day delivery; something that customers who are purchasing essentials urgently will really appreciate.
Read on to see which popular products are available on it.
Popular products to get on Glovida
Ceradan Ceramide Skin Barrier Repair Cream

Those who suffer from eczema-prone skin or extremely dry and flaky skin will be familiar with Ceradan’s line of products.
The brand is often recommended by dermatologists to those who suffer from dry, itchy or sensitive skin because of its patented formula that features a unique ratio of ceramides, proven to improve eczema-prone skin.
While Ceradan also carries body wash, diaper cream and even mosquito repellent cream, its Ceramide Skin Barrier Repair Cream is definitely its standout product.
This gives relief to dry, sensitive, inflamed, and irritated skin with a compromised skin barrier, and it is also safe to be used on newborns, and on both body and face.
Glovida stocks the Clinic Pack Size that you can usually only find in clinics. While its retail price is similar to what you can typically find in the market, it offers a special price of $66 each (instead of $68) if you purchase two units as a bundle - this is a steal that you can’t get anywhere else!
