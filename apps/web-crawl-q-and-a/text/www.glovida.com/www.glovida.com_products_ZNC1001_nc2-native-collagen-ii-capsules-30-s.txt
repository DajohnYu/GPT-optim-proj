             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  NC2 Native Collagen II is composed of 10mg of native type II collagen (undenatured) and 12mg Vitamin C.
For improved joint comfort, mobility, and the resulting ability to carry out various daily activities, it is important to preserve high quality and normal function of cartilage.
Collagen is a structural protein naturally present in abundance in all bodily tissue. Type II collagen is more specifically found at the joint cartilage level. The type II collagen in NC2 is obtained through a unique and patented procedure at low temperature, which ensures its quality.  This type of processing makes it possible to obtain type II collagen with its original structure intact, with the triple helix form keeping its epitopes.
Vitamin C contributes to collagen formation for the function of cartilage. It is involved in many functions.
Made in Belgium
