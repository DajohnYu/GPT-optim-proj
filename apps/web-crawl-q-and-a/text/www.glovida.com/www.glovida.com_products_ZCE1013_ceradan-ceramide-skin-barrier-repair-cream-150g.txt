             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Ceradan® repair cream is a ceramide-dominant skin barrier repair moisturizer that replenishes ceramide levels. For those with skin conditions such as eczema, ceramide levels are markedly reduced in the correct 3:1:1 ratio of intercellular physiological lipids (ceramide, cholesterol, free fatty acids).
Ceradan® repair Cream contains a large concentration of ceramides. Ceramides are natural lipids which bind skin cells together and comprise a major component of the skin’s surface structure. 
People suffering from skin conditions which make the skin dry, sensitive and inflamed are often low in ceramides. Irritated skin usually has a compromised protective barrier, which leaves it vulnerable to being affected by various environmental irritants.
BENEFITS:
• Mildly acidic pH levels inhibit skin serine proteases from breaking down the skin barrier. 
• Laboratory tested and verified to be hypoallergenic. 
• Suitable for both facial and bodily use.
• Safe for use at all ages, from newborns to the very elderly. 
• Contains no: Parabens, steroids, Lanolin, colours, fragrance or plant-derived squalene.

Developed in Japan, Made in Singapore
DIRECTIONS:
Apply twice daily or as many times as needed.
EXPIRY DATE:
30-May-2024
