Put this in the fridge - anyone in the family can access to it easily. It's soothing and calming for rashes, itch, insect bites and inflammation. Simply love it! Leslye Chan 2021-06-08  must try read the great reviews by other users and decided to try. and it is really one of the best aloe vera gel i've tried. Katharine Tan 2020-10-06  Safe and good It's nice to know this particular aloe vera gel does not contain paraben or any toxic/harmful ingredients. It has been very useful to calm my husband's sunburnt skin recently, and my kid's insect bites area. But it does not work that well on my eczema-ish skin though. Always patch test first. Huey  2020-07-28  RELIEVES & SOOTHES THE "SENSITIVE TO MASK" FACE Have been having some redness on my face, after wearing the mask out for the day. Tried applying Acuralle aloe vera gel and it works perfectly well to calm my skin. Yes, value for money too :) AGNES 2020-04-30  About the great healing effect of Acurelle Aloe Vera Gel Have been looking for an aloe gel without paraben for a long time.  Found this just as I needed one the most. 
My right palm had blisters and a deep open wound due to some harsh hand washing agents.  Acuralle aloe vera gel soothed the painful blisters in minutes, wound was closed by the next day of application.
