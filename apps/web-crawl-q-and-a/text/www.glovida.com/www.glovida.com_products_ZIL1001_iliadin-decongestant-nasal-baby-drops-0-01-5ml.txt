One of the leading cough drops for infants, Iliadin comes in an easy-to-use drop format that makes it perfect for babies 1 month to 1 year of age. It effectively offers a fast-acting solution to mucus build-up and nasal congestion. Finally, the cough drop gently clears blocked nose to improve airflow and ease your baby’s breathing.
BENEFITS:
• Instantly relieves nasal congestion by breaking down mucus structure.
• Gently clears baby’s blocked nose to improve airflow.
• Promotes breathing ease.
Made in Netherlands
DIRECTIONS:
For a baby too young to blow his nose, use an infant nasal aspirator (Bulb) which is available at the pharmacy. Gently aspirate out the mucus using the aspirator, catch the discharge outside the nostril using a cotton bud, roll it around and pull the remaining discharge out of the baby’s nose. Tilt head back slightly and instill 1-2 drops into each nostril with dropper provided. Infants up to 4 weeks old: 1 drop 2-3 times daily . 5 weeks to 12 months old : 1-2 drops, 2-3 times daily.
