                       Oh no! Looks like we ran out of this product. Do register to get notified once we've stocked up!  Notify Me Product Details Description  Remescar assists in the healing process of both new and old scars resulting from surgery, burns, bug bites, acne, stretch marks, etc., by releasing a thin and discrete silicone-based film to provide a suitable healing micro-environment for the scar while maintaining the skin’s natural moisture balance. It can also be used as a preventive therapy on closed wounds to reduce scarring or for post laser treatment and helps to relieve the burning and itching of the scarred tissue. 

Beta-glucan has strong, calming, protective and hydrating properties. It's an excellent film former. The combination of β-glucan with polymeric film formers such as PVP (Polyvinyl pyrrolidone) and PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) help to accelerate the wound healing process. 

Besides the film formation, which is the first and most important action of Remescar, it also contains strong UV filters. It is widely known that scars need to be protected from UV radiation. That is why this scar stick incorporates powerful UV-A and UV-B filters.
