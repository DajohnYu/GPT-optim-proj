          Vivomixx Probiotics Drop With Vitamin D3 10ml
          Vivomixx Probiotics Drop With Vitamin D3 10ml  (7) Brand: Vivomixx  S$34.60 
                  vs. Retail Price:

             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Vivomixx Probiotics Drop contains freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. Eight different stains of bacteria were selected, grown in specific culture media and then mixed in proportion to optimize the effects. 
Liquid suspension works particularly well with small children who are incapable of swallowing capsules. A popular method to manage the problem is opening the capsules and dissolving the content in water or juice; however, that is not a good way because the manufacturer of the product might not have prepared the product for such a form of administration, which can limit its activity.
Vivomixx Probiotics Drop does not contain gluten, soy, preservatives and synthetic sweeteners. It may contain traces of milk. 0.5 ml correspond to 5 billion live lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria & 400 IU Vitamin D

Content: 1 bottle of 10 ml with a 1500mg sachet and 1 graduated dispenser
BENEFITS:
• Defends against diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, and irritable bowel syndrome
• Protects against a number of gut-related issues
• Vitamin D3 for support immune system, bone health and muscle strength.
• 1 bottle contains 10 ml, equivalent to 100 drops.
Made in Italy
DOSAGE:
Recommended dosage: 0.5-1 ml per day, corresponding to 5-10 billion bacteria and 400-800 IU of Vitamin D.
The product can be mixed with water and non-carbonated drinks or other cold liquids. For infants, Vivomixx drop can be added to formula milk.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE:
Screw the bottle cap in anti-clockwise direction to break the seal. 
Tear open the sachet containing the probiotic powder. 
Empty the sachet contents into the bottle. Shake vigorously to obtain a uniform suspension. 
Remove the bottle cap and place the graduated dispenser. Always shake before every use.
Once reconstituted, it must be kept refrigerated and used within 3 weeks.
CARE & STORAGE:
Vivomixx products are refrigerated in our warehouse at all times. Vivomixx contains live bacteria which are sensitive to heat, it is therefore recommended to keep the product refrigerated. However it may be stored at room temperature for UP TO ONE WEEK without the quality of the probiotics being compromised. Packing and delivering of probiotics are done on the very same day. We do not accept exchanges or returns after products are delivered.
EXPIRY DATE:
