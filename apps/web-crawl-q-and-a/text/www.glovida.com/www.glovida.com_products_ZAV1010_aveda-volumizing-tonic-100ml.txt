I have really fine hair, so it definitely adds volume without weighing down my hair or adding to product build up. I can still go a couple days without washing my hair - whereas other volumizing products I've used I have to wash my hair everyday as it feels greasy after the first day. Diana 2017-06-26  Really Works!! I have tried lots of different hair volumizers, with varying degrees of success. This one tops them all. I will be reordering this. It's a little pricey, but worth it!!! Arielle  2017-05-05  I absolutely love this product! I have been hearing about the volumizing tonic but never quite got down to it.
I am now a convert! It gives the hair a volume boost, without any sticky residue and gives a good hair day everyday! (Great price and service by the way) Kelly Kristine 2017-03-20  love this!   this is my favourite item product of all the Aveda range of products!   Casey Neo 2017-01-10  love it! this is my go-to and I always buy it after my visit to the salon.  
love the price here and I buy the shampoo and conditioner together to have it delivered to my house.  fuss-free, easy, efficient and wonderful service by the team at Glovida.  Excellent! Jan 2016-11-14  Got this for my hubby, very prompt delivery and easy to order The husband's been using this for years. Glad to find it here. Cheaper!
