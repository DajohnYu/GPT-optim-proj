             ADD TO CART  Product Details Description  Here’s a treat for dry skin: Ego QV Cream 100g! Ego QV Cream is a moisturising, protective cream that provides deep skin hydration. It replenishes the skin with squalene, a natural component within the skin’s oil to effectively seal the natural moisture. 
This cream especially targets areas that are prone to intense dryness, like the hands, knees, and elbows. It’s low irritant and works well even with the most sensitive skin to stave off further drying and bring back the skin’s natural moisture. Continued use also addresses and corrects skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, winter itch, and dermatitis. 
QV Skincare established since 1953, is one of Australia's most favourite skincare brands.
BENEFITS:
• Effectively moisturises and hydrates dryness-prone areas of the skin.
• Staves off further drying by replenishing the skin with squalene.
• Corrects and addresses skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.
• Acts as the skin's protective barrier.
• Perfectly seals off skin’s moisture especially during dry and winter seasons.
• Non-comedogenic, free from fragrance, colour, lanolin and propylene glycol.
• Suitable for infants and the elderly.
Made in Australia
DIRECTIONS:
Apply to affected area as often as required, particularly after showering, bathing, shaving and exposure to harsh climate conditions and at night. Suitable for daily use. For best results, remember to moisturize immediately after your bath or shower for soft hydrated skin.
