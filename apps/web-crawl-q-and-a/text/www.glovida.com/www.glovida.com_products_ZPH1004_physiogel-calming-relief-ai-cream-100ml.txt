Price is higher compared to other brands but lower when purchased on glovida. Highly recommended. Joshua 2017-08-16  Works great for Child Ezcema This is one of the only creams which helps my daughter's Ezcema. It's pricier than other creams but the itch and scratching has been reduced by almost 95%! Jason 2017-07-19  Fantastic service by Glovida I like how there is the bundle promo of further discounts with purchases of 2 or more. Physiogel AI cream really works for me and being able to purchase it so conveniently is really helpful. Marrilyn 2017-04-19  yay! I usually have to get this from my doctor!  did a online search and found it here on Glovida!  Now I do not have to go to the clinic for this and I can enjoy better prices and home delivery!   Penny 2017-02-20  This is a quality product I have sensitive skin and get rashes easily. Have been using many different products to manage my skin and in times of desperation, steriod cream... A good friend recommended this product to me and I decided to give it a try. I must say this really is a quality product. I used just a tiny dap over my rashes and within a very short time, my rashes and itch subsided. This will be a staple for me and the price here is good plus there is delivery service which I appreciate.  Highly recommended!  Thank you, Glovida. Patricia Khaw 2017-02-02  This really works I have very sensitive skin and get rashes every now and then.  My friend told me about this site and this particular product and I gave it a try.  It really helped to calm my skin and reduce the rashes.  Thank you for making it available on your site and I appreciate the better price that I can find  here too.   lynn 2017-01-18  This wonder product works for my dish-pan hands saves me time by getting it online and next-day delivery concept. Price is the cheapest I could find. Great work Team Glovida.  Lyndy 2016-11-14  Saves me the trouble of going to the clinic This is the only thing that works for my eczema but always found it a chore to go to the clinic to purchase.
