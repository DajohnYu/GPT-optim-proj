Find a balance between the generation of knowledge based on curiosity versus generation based on specific applications with an intense promotion of global ties and cooperation.<br/><br/>Economy: Our knowledge economy must be able to take advantage of emerging technologies to enhance existing strengths in specific sectors with high innovative potential and to direct financial resources towards the support of innovation processes. Stimulate the transfer of knowledge and co-creation processes between scientific artists and entrepreneurs from different sectors of society.<br/><br/>Digital Technology: Costa Rica must be a connected society based on an inclusive, safe, responsible and productive approach. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are catalysts for the economic and social development of nations, so they enhance each of the previous pillars.<br/><br/>A set of transversal principles guides the construction in the medium and long term of a Costa Rican society that responds to these pillars: the respect to human rights, sustainability, quality, the universality of access to knowledge and ethics.<br/><br/>The consolidation of a System of Science, Technology and Innovation that responds to this vision of the Costa Rican society is the north for the future actions of MICITT.

For instance, ‘discrimination impact assessments’ are suggested as one possible measure to address hidden bias and discrimination in AI, citing the existence of ‘privacy impact assessments’ in European law. <br/>The report also explores the ‘black box problem’—it is easy to explain the data going in to the AI program and easy to explain the data that comes out, but what occurs within is difficult for most people to understand. As such, technologies that ‘explain’ AI processes will be increasingly important as AI becomes more commonly used. The report also extensively canvasses the issue of automation, and the need for retraining measures to mitigate its impact on the workforce. At a regulatory level, the report emphasises that designing procedures, tools, and methods that allow for the auditing of AI systems will be key in ensuring that the systems conform to legal and ethical frameworks. It also suggests that it will be necessary to “instate a national advisory committee on ethics for digital technology and artificial intelligence, within an institutional framework.”","Activities: Identify areas of oversight reform|Challenge(s) addressed: Risks to human safety, Unethical use (e.g. dual-use technologies), Security|Type(s) of oversight or advice: Ethical principles (e.g. integrity, accountability, impartiality), Guidelines, Regulations"

It proposes the following:<br/>(i) Develop algorithm transparency and audits: by developing the capacities necessary to observe, understand and audit their operation. To do so, a group of experts must be created to analyse algorithms and databases, and research on explainability must be supported to encourage civil society to carry out its own evaluations.<br/>This means focusing on three areas of research: producing more explainable models, producing more interpretable user interfaces, and understanding the mechanisms at work in order to produce satisfactory explanations.<br/>(ii) Consider the responsibility of AI actors for the ethical issues at stake: (a) By including ethics in training for AI engineers and researchers. (b) By carrying out a discrimination impact assessment, along the lines of France’s privacy impact assessment (PIA), to encourage AI designers to consider the social implications of the algorithms they produce.<br/>(iii) Create a consultative ethics committee for digital technologies and AI, which would organize public debate in this field. This committee would have a high level of expertise and independence. Indeed, 94% of those interviewed considered that the development of AI in our society should be regularly addressed in public debates.<br/>(iv) Guarantee the principle of human responsibility, particularly when AI tools are used in public services. This includes setting boundaries for the use of predictive algorithms in the law enforcement context.

Creating and working within one or more Knowledge Centre / R&I Ecosystem, Centres for Smart Specialization, and peer learning through international networks such as ASEF, Eurashe and UAS4Europe.<br/>3. Developing and propagating new research, innovation and pedagogical & andragogic methodologies and technologies.","All MCAST Senior Lecturers, Associate Professors and Full Professors are expected to carry out academic research related to their area of specialization as directed by MCAST. Each institute at MCAST has a Senior Research Officer (SROs) in order to drive and support the adoption of research initiatives by institute academic staff and to facilitate inter and intra institute research initiatives. Additionally, the SROs work with academics in drafting research proposals pre-award and to be familiar with different funding options available for research in the MCAST vocational areas. SROs also help to support the lecturers in putting together research funding bids.|To establish and promote adequate processes and procedures to incentivize the lecturing staff to embark on new projects at national and international level.|To establish research partnerships within and outside the College","New policy instrument launched in 2019 and is formally available to MCAST Academics to take on research individually or in collaboration with other academics, industry, social partners or community groups. <br/>The Research Framework encapsulates a number of dimensions pertinent to the implementation of research by MCAST academics in collaboration with industry. One particular dimension is the Ethics Committee and corresponding policies and procedures. The Ethics Committee also functions within the Applied Research and Innovation Centre and ensures that all MCAST related research projects are (a) collated into a comprehensive database that is shared with the Data and Information Commission (b) an assurance that all research projects abide by rigorous ethical expectations.

The HTS also aims to improve and accelerate the transfer of research into new products and services. The High-Tech Strategy 2025 focuses on three major<br/>fields of action.","1 Tackling the major societal challenges<br/>The strategy focusses on research that is geared to current and future needs and that is relevant to people’s everyday lives. The goal is to achieve technological and non-technological innovations, including social innovations, which focus on benefiting the people. To this end, the strategy is developing missions and setting concrete goals which unite the support of science, business and society. The High-Tech Strategy 2025 is specifically promoting research into issues that are relevant to the German economy and society. The Focus is in particular on the areas of Healthcare, Sustainability, Climate Action and Energy, Mobility, Urban and Rural Areas, Safety and Security, and Economy and Work 4.0.|2 Strengthening Germany’s future competencies<br/>The strategy aims to systematically and consistently evolve future competencies for a progressive Germany. To this end, it is promoting key enabling technologies that also open up new and disruptive innovation potential with their broad range of applications and strengthen the German economy in international competition. At the same time, the promotion of research and technology is accompanied with additional training and further education measures.|3 Establishing an open innovation and venture culture<br/>For innovative results, the strategy promotes innovative forms of cooperation that create spaces for ideas and involve new actors in the innovation process. To ensure that research results feed even more effectively into practical application, the strategy is strengthening transfer, supporting open forms of innovation and the development of leapfrog innovations, promoting entrepreneurial spirit and innovative strength in SMEs.","In September 2018, the fourth edition (after 2006, 2010 and 2014) of the High-Tech Strategy was adopted by the German government. The HTS is developed further as a comprehensive, interdepartmental innovation strategy. New topics were added and new instruments for funding innovation introduced. The upward trend in investments in research and development is continued.<br/><br/>The HTS is considered to be a living, learning process which is continuously reconsidered. A consulting body, the High-Tech Forum, which consists of representatives of science, industry and society, is charged with developing proposals for the strategy‘s further development and implementation. In 2020, the BMBF realized a pilot for a participation process with seven regional dialogues. The objectives were to foster cooperation of traditional and new actors in order to strengthen innovation topics relevant to the region and to regionally relevant innovation topics and to provide regional ideas as inspiration for the federal innovation system.<br/><br/>Following a review, the strategy now includes twelve missions in areas where solutions to major challenges can only be found in cooperation with all stakeholders. These missions unite science, business and society behind common goals. HTS has linked up topics in various fields of innovation policy across Federal Ministries. Aspects related to funding are addressed in connection with efforts to improve general conditions. Individual fields of technology are seen as contributions to realising important social policy aims or as innovation drivers for other fields of technology (“key technologies”), while social change is considered to be an important prerequisite for the generation of technological knowledge. International and interdisciplinary co-operation will be further enhanced through appropriate measures.<br/><br/>Under the umbrella of the current High-Tech Strategy, all of the Federal Government‘s departments are developing joint aims and implementation steps to which all players in innovation activities – at the municipal, national and European levels – can orient their efforts.",Not applicable,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF;Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung)|Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi;Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie),http://www.hightech-strategie.de/,false,,,false,,Governance|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Public research system|Research and innovation for society|Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing,Business innovation policy strategies|Cross-disciplinary research|Mission-oriented innovation policies|Public research strategies|Research and innovation for society strategy|STI plan or strategy|Transfer and linkages strategies,"Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers|Social groups especially emphasised",Academic societies / academies|Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Established researchers|Firms of any age|PhD students|Postdocs and other early-career researchers|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|SMEs,http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/4575/instrument/10294,Governance,"Strategies, agendas and plans",,,"Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 2- Public bodies are expected to plan activities based on strategy|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Governance|Follow-up mechanism: Periodic monitoring and/or evaluation of progress|Foresight exercise included: Yes|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: Health, Energy security, Climate change, Environmental sustainability, Other|Specific sector(s) targeted: None specifically targeted|Strategy mainly prioritises: STI policy governance (e.g. vertical and horizontal coordination, evaluation)"
http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/4581,Malta,SMART SPECIALISATION STRATEGY AS PART OF THE NATIONAL R&I STRATEGY 2020,,,2014,2020,"As expressed in Malta's 2020 national R&I Strategy (published in 2014), eight thematic areas of smart specialization have been identified. These are: tourism product development; maritime services; aviation and aerospace; health, with a focus on healthy living, active ageing and e-health; resource-efficient buildings; high value-added manufacturing with a focus on process and design; and aquaculture. In addition, ICT was identified both as a horizontal enabler across all specialisation areas, as well as a Smart Specialisation niche in itself.","Identify, through an entrepreneurial discovery process, those niches within the economy where Malta could have a particular advantage in innovation. It is intended that Malta R&I activities align with the eight thematic areas as outlined in the strategy.","The National R&I Strategy (including smart specialisation) will be complemented by a dedicated R&I Action Plan. Maritime services is a mature and diversified economic sector in which Malta has a historic legacy and world-level profile. Malta has built a strong portfolio in avionics research, a relatively high critical mass of human resources as well as numerous established international R&D links in the area. Innovative e-health solutions as well as solutions for active and healthy ageing will be given particular consideration because both of these focus areas benefit from the integration of medical sciences with other areas where Malta has a strong knowledge base; such as ICT, social sciences and engineering. Both have a clear economic objective and the potential for a strong economic impact. The construction sector in Malta accounts for 4% of GVA and 5.4% in terms of employment (2012 data) however these figures have been decreasing over the past years. There is scope for exploring innovative solutions in the sector which address water scarcity and energy (dependence on fossil fuels, take up of renewable energy sources, etc.), both of which remain two of Malta’s major economic challenges. In manufacturing, two focus areas for innovation are process innovation (through optimisation of resource use, energy efficiency, automation etc.) and innovation in product design (product development, prototyping, etc.). Malta’s aquaculture industry has developed to its present status over a period of around twenty years. R&D is carried out both within the public and the private sector. Malta has developed a good degree of know-how in this sector and has participated in a number of EU-funded R&D projects.<br/><br/>The 2020 National Research and Innovation Strategy identified ""Smart, Flexible Specialisation"" as one of its main goals. Eight thematic areas of Smart Specialization have been identified which are listed as: (a) Tourism product development, (b) Maritime Services, (c) Aviation and aerospace, (d) Health with a focus on healthy living and active ageing, and e-health, (e) Resource-efficient buildings, (f) High-value added manufacturing with a focus on processes and design, (g) Aquaculture. As part of the implementation of the smart specialisation strategy, a dedicated Action Plan is presently being drafted to support, inter alia, inter disciplinary research at the interface of the identified specialisation areas. In June 2014, the Malta Council for Science and Technology launched the National Research and Innovation Strategy 2020, which set out Malta’s strategy for the forthcoming seven-year period. A decision was made to separate the strategic vision from the rolling R&I Action Plan, which aims to implement the action lines identified in the Strategy and which is currently being finalised. Following the launch of the Strategy, in 2014 a consultation process was launched to identify which measures already in place or in the pipeline, address the action lines of the strategy. The process involved extensive consultations with over 20 entities and ministries and a first list of measures was drawn up. Three iterations of this process took place between February 2014 to February 2015, to ensure that the latest information was available, that the ministries were properly engaged, and also to give time for the stakeholders to develop their plans further and concretise their measures, timelines and budgets. As part of the monitoring mechanism being set up to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and roll out of the Action Plan, two groups were set up: the Steering Group and Core Group. The groups started meeting since the inception of the drafting of the Research and Innovation Action Plan. The Core Group meets at Permanent Secretary level and is responsible for deciding on priorities for action as well as timeframes, resources and budgets on the basis of recommendations made by the Steering Group. The Steering Group meets at the level of Heads of Public Entities and Organisations or their high-level delegates. In the last quarter of 2014, the Steering Group and Core Group started meeting regularly, to begin filtering the measures and identifying those that could stimulate R&I and help achieve the 7 ambitious targets set in Chapter 9 of the Strategy. In 2015 MCST organised another round of focus groups as part of the ongoing entrepreneurial discovery process which engages academia, business, government and civil society as part of the Smart Specialisation Strategy. The process has enabled further sub-specialisation and the identification of Malta’s niche areas in the European and/or internationalisation arena. With the assistance of the European Commission’s Policy Support Facility, MCST is now finalising key performance indicators for monitoring the Strategy’s implementation and ensuring that the Action Plan remains on target to achieve its goals. Aquaculture: There is a good degree of collaboration between the public and private sector, however there is scope for exploring further consolidation of existing strengths by focusing on areas of common interest among different players. Infrastructure investments in the area include plans for a local hatchery. Maltese aquaculture can therefore capitalise on these strengths and differentiate itself as a leading innovator in aquaculture. Aviation and aerospace is a relatively new economic sector which has grown rapidly, attracted several foreign investors, and has diversified to include a number of niches such as maintenance, repair and overhaul and aircraft registration among others. There is scope for further investment to raise the level of achievement to the next level by venturing into the high value-added engineering market in order to move up the value chain in specific niches within the aerospace sector. Tourism is a key pillar of economic activity in Malta. The sector is well established and mature and there is a good degree of collaboration among operators. The sector is not R&D intensive but must innovate in order to remain attractive and competitive. Consultations yielded several avenues for innovation activity, however innovation in tourism product development was repeatedly highlighted as a key niche where Malta has potential for growth through innovation. In addition to linkages with other specialisation areas such as ICT and health, this specialisation area should involve extensive collaboration with the creative industries. Innovation in resource efficient buildings would transform the sector by increasing value-added, increasing green jobs and growth while at the same time addressing a societal challenge which is in itself a business opportunity. This specialisation area will focus on solutions for improved resource efficiency in new and existing buildings through, inter alia, demonstration projects and optimisation. Maritime services currently offered are varied but are still fragmented. There is therefore scope for improved clustering of maritime services. Malta’s drive towards becoming a maritime hub should include a drive to foster innovation in maritime engineering, ICT, design and services. ICT plays an important role in R&D and innovation in all sectors by facilitating the development of new goods, processes and services to modernise the economy and transform it to a knowledge-based one. Computer and related activities constituted 11.7% of the intramural R&D expenditure recorded in 2010 and 5.4% of the total innovation expenditure for the same year. The main research expenditure was on software consultancy and supply. In addition, ICT is one of the areas where Malta’s participation in FP7 is strongest (around 14% of FP projects involving a Maltese participant were in 8 - Achieving smart, flexible specialisation the ICT field). Malta’s participation in COST actions also indicates significant activity, with around 14% of Actions in which Malta participates being in the ICT Domain. All consultations undertaken in the preparation of the present Strategy acknowledged the crucial role of ICT innovation in all sectors of the economy. In manufacturing, while its share of GVA as a percentage of total GVA has decreased over time, the GVA in real terms of the manufacturing sector has increased over the past years. This sector remains predominant for research and innovation investment. Statistics for 2010 indicate that manufacturing activity encompassed 65.4% of all innovation expenditure and 62.2% of intramural R&D expenditure. This indicates clearly that, in spite of shifts towards the services sector, the manufacturing sector is still strong and should therefore be sustained through a greater focus on innovation niches within this sector. Various data sources (such as public R&D expenditure, participation in the European Cooperation in Science and Technology – COST, and publications) indicate that ""health and medical research"" is a significant component of Malta’s R&D investment. However, there appears to be significant fragmentation within it and there is scope for further exploration of innovation potential in this area.",Less than 1M,Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST;Malta Council for Science and Technology),,false,,,false,,Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Public research system|Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing,"Business innovation policy strategies|Cluster policies|Cross-disciplinary research|National ocean strategies and policy coordination|Ocean technology transfer and commercialisation|Support for business research, development and innovation|Transfer and linkages strategies","Economic actors (individuals)|Governmental entities|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers|Social groups especially emphasised",Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Established researchers|Higher education institutes|National government|Postdocs and other early-career researchers|Public research institutes,http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/4581/instrument/16160,Governance,"Strategies, agendas and plans",,,"Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 2- Public bodies are expected to plan activities based on strategy|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Research, Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Governance, Other|Follow-up mechanism: Periodic monitoring and/or evaluation of progress, Dedicated coordinating/monitoring public body|Foresight exercise included: Yes|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: Ageing populations, Energy security, Climate change|Specific sector(s) targeted: Energy, Marine / Ocean, Aerospace, Health and healthcare, Telecommunications and IT, Other manufacturing, Other services|Strategy mainly prioritises: STI policy governance (e.g. vertical and horizontal coordination, evaluation), Clusters and regional support (including regional/local R&D investments), Specific areas/sectors (e.g. new industrial policy, R&D targets for clean tech), Public research capabilities, Stakeholder participation and consultation"

This 2013 published roadmap provides an overview of RIs that were selected in this process or that were currently being established. One distinguishing feature is that it only includes those projects for which there is in principle a public funding intention. In August 2015, after an evaluation of the pilot process, a revised and consolidated national roadmap process was announced, which was concluded in September 2019 with the announcement of the prioritised concepts for the new updated roadmap for RIs.","The efficient access to large RIs is essential for every scientific system. High investment costs and long-lasting construction phases of RIs require a fair strategic prioritisation process. The national RI roadmap process serves to prepare and prioritise - in terms of research policy - future and long-term investments in national and international scientific infrastructures with German involvement. General objectives of the national RI roadmap process are - the applicability to all scientific disciplines, - the support of political decisions on contribution to European/international RIs, - the realisation of a transparent process with external assessment - and the provision of planning reliability for selected projects at an early stage. In principal, though always subject to unforeseeable budgetary constrains, considerable public funding of (mainly) the investment costs of prioritised projects is intended for the development phases that should have a maximum duration of 10 years. On the other hand, the planned duration of the user-financed utilisation phases of RIs must be at least 10 years following their completion.","BMBF had conducted a pilot process from 2011 to 2013 to draw up a roadmap for large RIs which received widespread support from across German science and research community. The 2013 published roadmap - during the pilot process initially restricted to the responsibility of BMBF - provides an overview of RIs that were selected in this process or that were currently being established. One distinguishing feature is that it only includes those projects for which there is in principle a public funding intention. A revised national roadmap process was announced to the public in August 2015 coping the responsibilities of all RI relevant ministries.

This 2013 published roadmap provides an overview of RIs that were selected in this process or that were currently being established. One distinguishing feature is that it only includes those projects for which there is in principle a public funding intention. In August 2015, after an evaluation of the pilot process, a revised and consolidated national roadmap process was announced, which was concluded in September 2019 with the announcement of the prioritised concepts for the new updated roadmap for RIs.","The efficient access to large RIs is essential for every scientific system. High investment costs and long-lasting construction phases of RIs require a fair strategic prioritisation process. The national RI roadmap process serves to prepare and prioritise - in terms of research policy - future and long-term investments in national and international scientific infrastructures with German involvement. General objectives of the national RI roadmap process are - the applicability to all scientific disciplines, - the support of political decisions on contribution to European/international RIs, - the realisation of a transparent process with external assessment - and the provision of planning reliability for selected projects at an early stage. In principal, though always subject to unforeseeable budgetary constrains, considerable public funding of (mainly) the investment costs of prioritised projects is intended for the development phases that should have a maximum duration of 10 years. On the other hand, the planned duration of the user-financed utilisation phases of RIs must be at least 10 years following their completion.","BMBF had conducted a pilot process from 2011 to 2013 to draw up a roadmap for large RIs which received widespread support from across German science and research community. The 2013 published roadmap - during the pilot process initially restricted to the responsibility of BMBF - provides an overview of RIs that were selected in this process or that were currently being established. One distinguishing feature is that it only includes those projects for which there is in principle a public funding intention. A revised national roadmap process was announced to the public in August 2015 coping the responsibilities of all RI relevant ministries. The process was open to participation by all interested universities and non-university research institutions that were planning to develop new RIs.

The results of the survey pointed to the need for a scheme that would provide financial assistance to academics wishing to forge links with foreign centres of R&I excellence. IPAS 2015 was only open to academics. Subsequent to the launch of the scheme, feedback from industry indicated a desire for this scheme to be extended. Given the feedback from industry, and the need to find an improved way of supporting networking in R&I for both academia and industry, IPAS 2016 was opened up to industry players. Proposed activities to be funded through this award should promote internationalisation, for example, through: (i) the development of joint teaching curricula for Masters or PhD students (ii) placements for local researchers in foreign institutions for the purposes of furthering research & innovation collaboration (iii) the arrangement of strategic and targeted visits by local academics/researchers and representatives of private entities to foreign entities in order to participate in research & innovation activities of an exploratory and developmental nature (iv) the organisation of seminars or workshops on a particular research and innovation area in Malta that would benefit from the participation of foreign experts (v) the development of transnational research & innovation proposals for submission to third party-funders, e.g. Horizon Europe, etc. In 2019, we added another R&I funding opportunity for Maltese entities intending to submit a Horizon Europe proposal as the coordinator of a consortium to engage a service provider (local or foreign) who will be supporting the applicant through proposal writing and submission.",Less than 1M,Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST;Malta Council for Science and Technology),http://mcst.gov.mt/ri-ipas-open-calls/,false,,,false,,Governance|Human resources for research and innovation|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Public research system|Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing,Competitive research funding|International mobility of human resources|International STI governance policy|Internationalisation in public research|Intersectoral mobility|Non-financial support to business R&D and innovation|Targeted support to SMEs,"Economic actors (individuals)|Researchers, students and teachers",Entrepreneurs|Established researchers,http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/4602/instrument/10779,Direct financial support,Project grants for public research,,,"Maximum amount of grant awarded in euros: Less than 100K|Maximum grant duration: 13-24 months|Requires a form of collaboration: With international partners|Selection criteria: Scientific impact anticipated|Success rate (share of grants awarded as a % of total applications): 40% or higher|Type of activity: Applied research|Type(s) of proposal screening: Internal: review by grant manager (e.g. funding agency), External peer review: including members of the scientific community, External peer review: including business society representatives"

Increase investments in R&D.|2. Make distinction between teaching and research activities - enable higher engagement of teaching staff in research activities.|3. Establish conditions for the re-functioning of academic and research network BIHARNET.|4. Create a Smart Specialization Strategy taking into account the research potential identified in RI Roadmap.|5. Intensify activities for the participation in DARIAH infrastructure and consider the possibility of participating in other Large pan-European infrastructures.|6. Improve the Legal and policy framework. Analysis of the current legal and policy framework has shown insufficient regulation in the area of R&D in the Federation of BiH. Only a few Cantons have regulated this area, while others do not have legal and policy documents that regulate R&D. In the context of the development of RIs, it is important to clearly define which organizations are considered as scientific research organizations. Additionally, the terms “Research Infrastructures” and Research Infrastructure Roadmap” should be defined within legal and policy documents on the Cantonal and Federation level. <br/><br/>7. Encouraging Open Access to RI. As a result of the “Open Access Research Infrastructure in the Western Balkans Support Programme” implemented by RCC secretariat in 2020, the University of Sarajevo, the University of Zenica and the University of Bihać adopted an Open Access Policy to Research Infrastructures. Building on the experience gained in this program, the FBiH Ministry of Education and Science should encourage other research institutions to adopt their own Open Access Policy documents.","This document has been developed in close cooperation with the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) that provided technical assistance to the FBiH Ministry of Education and Science in the Federation of BiH in this assignment. The technical assistance was provided as part of a broader action that included the provision of assistance to other Western Balkan economies with the final goal to contribute to creating the Western Balkans’ Roadmap of Research Infrastructures (WBRRI).<br/>The mapping exercise in BiH was specific since it consisted of two separate parts. While the survey in the Federation of BiH was conducted between February and March 2021, the mapping of the RIs in other entity of BiH (Republic of Srpska) was conducted in 2019, which resulted in the creation of RI Roadmap of the Republic of Srpska.

The sub-transformations and changes created by the megatrends have been examined in detail from the perspective of R&D and innovation system and technology development. <br/><br/>In accordance with the early outcomes of the Foresight Study on technological trends, one may expect a world where digitalization is becoming more integrated with daily lives and economies as fastes as never before and the world witnesses the rapid rise of digital technologies; especially artificial intelligience, internet of things; and the rising need for cyber security regarding the accelerating digitalization.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously accelerated all the digitalization processes by all means; in the simplest terms of for instance social distancing technologies, by distance education system trials, by transforming health systems, and of course financial operations. The way we interact with the digital world is also changing, moving beyond behind the screens and keyboards to a combination of interaction modalities and connectivity in all terms. <br/><br/>In line with the early stage conclusions of the Foresight Study, the main paradigm shift is happening in a context of continuing technological development of ICT, AI, connectivity technologies, quantum computing, the rising need for cyber security, space technologies, new materials for chip technologies beyond silicon, digitalization and transformation of health technologies, bio and nanotechnology, clean and renewable technologies; green economy while the world is becoming hyper-connected as never before; as well as the environmental challanges rising such as climate change and drought.<br/>In the final phase of the study which is planned to be completed in the second half of 2021, Advisory orientations and opinions of leading public institutions, senior private sector institutions in our country in terms of economic activities and/or R&D expenditures, venture capital funding organizations, technology-based startup companies and senior researchers/academicians, in order to determine the changes that are considered to have the most significant and transformative impact for our country will be taken through a detailed Delphi Survey which is currently under implementation and Focus Groups Meetings to be held subsequently right after the Delphi Analysis. It is hence planned to evaluate the possibility of the realization of the mega trends that may trigger global transformation and the impact of our country on the level of global competition.",Not applicable,"Science Technology And Innovation Policies Council (STIPC;Bilim, Teknoloji ve Yenilik Politikaları Kurulu)|Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK;Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu)",,false,Prioritised COVID-related research/innovation support,,false,,Countering impacts of COVID-19 on STI systems|Governance|Public research system,Cross-disciplinary research|Mitigating long-term impacts of COVID-19|STI plan or strategy|Strategic policy intelligence,"Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers|Social groups especially emphasised",Academic societies / academies|Civil society|Established researchers|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Industry associations|National government|Public research institutes,http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/99992623/instrument/99992702,Governance,"Policy intelligence (e.g. evaluations, benchmarking and forecasts)",Foresight,,"Provides input to: Problem definition, Policy design, Policy implementation|Study performed by: Public administration|Type of information: Forecasting and foresight studies"

Concerning the new way of approaching public instruments, it is worth highlighting a series of considerations along with the transversal axes and the strategic challenges described above:<br/> The financing instrument requires specifying whether it aims to finance private goods (innovation projects executed by firms) or public goods (generation of non-appropriable goods or services, by any actor in the National Innovation System).<br/> Also, the project to be financed has to be adapted to the needs and the life stage of the project, understanding that both the innovation projects of private goods, as well as the public goods that enable innovation are heterogeneous in various dimensions. For example, there is no common pattern regarding technological intensity, scale, whether it is scientifically based or not, or whether it is a radical or incremental innovation.<br/>This is especially important in the final stages of the project, particularly around the implementation and commercialization of the innovation. In the review process of the instruments by LIP, the lack of support instruments for this phase was underscored, not only those from FIA, but from all the public instruments.<br/> To ensure the successful closure of the projects, a support tool is also created in the implementation phase of the innovation, called “consolidation” of the project. At this stage, efforts will be made to adapt public support according to the specific needs of the beneficiary and the project in particular: financing, creation and / or strengthening of the capacities necessary to market (e.g. establish contacts with the distribution chain or advice to manage the business plan). FIA will provide support at two different levels, according to the project: connection with other FIA instruments (such as consultancies or events), or connection with other actors of the National Innovation System (such as business incubators).<br/><br/> However, it is understood that the user's ""journey"" to develop innovation projects (or an innovation enabler in the case of public goods) is not uniform. From Figure 17 it can be seen that there are 7 different ways to finance a project: according to the type of asset to be financed, and according to the activities and the phase in which the innovative project is.",Less than 1M,Foundation for Agricultural Innovation (FIA;Fundación para la Innovación Agraria),http://proyectos2020.fia.cl/|http://www.fia.cl/convocatorias/,true,,,true,http://bibliotecadigital.fia.cl/handle/20.500.11944/145545,Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Public research system,Competitive research funding|Financial support to business R&D and innovation,Firms by age|Firms by size|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations,Academic societies / academies|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Industry associations|Private research and development lab|Technology transfer offices,http://stip.oecd.org/2021/data/policyInitiatives/99994253/instrument/99995313,Direct financial support,Procurement programmes for R&D and innovation,,,
