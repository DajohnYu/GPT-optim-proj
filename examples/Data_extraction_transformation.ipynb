    "A lot of enterprise data is unstructured and locked up in difficult-to-use formats, e.g. PDFs, PPT, PNG, that are not optimized for use with LLMs or databases. As a result this type of data tends to be underutilized for analysis and product development, despite it being so valuable. The traditional way of extracting information from unstructured or non-ideal formats has been to use OCR, but OCR struggles with complex layouts and can have limited multilingual support. \n",
