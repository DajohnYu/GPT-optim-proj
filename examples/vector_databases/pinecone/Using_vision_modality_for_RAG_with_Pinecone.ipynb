    "## Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Documents with Integrated Images, Graphics and Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents unique challenges when working with documents rich in images and tables. Traditional RAG models excel with textual data but often falter when visual elements play a crucial role in conveying information. In this cookbook, we bridge that gap by leveraging vision models to extract and interpret visual content, ensuring that the generated responses are as informative and accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves parsing documents into images and utilizing metadata tagging to identify pages containing images or tables. When a semantic search retrieves such a page, we pass the page image to a vision model instead of relying solely on text. This method enhances the model's ability to understand and answer user queries that pertain to visual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we will explore and demonstrate the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Setting Up a Vector Store with Pinecone:\n",
    "- Learn how to initialize and configure Pinecone to store vector embeddings efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Parsing PDFs and Extracting Visual Information:\n",
    "- Discover techniques for converting PDF pages into images.\n",
    "- Use GPT-4o vision modality to detect pages with images or tables and extract pertinent information. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Generating Embeddings: \n",
    "- Utilize embedding models to create vector representations of textual data. \n",
    "- Flag the pages that have visual content so that we can use it for meta-data filters on vector store if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Uploading embeddings to Pinecone: \n",
    "- Upload these embeddings to Pinecone for storage and retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Performing Semantic Search for Relevant Pages:\n",
    "- Implement semantic search on page text to find pages that best match the user's query. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Handling Pages with Visual Content:\n",
    "- Learn how to pass the image using GPT-4o vision modality for question answering with additional context. \n",
    "- Understand how this process improves the accuracy of responses involving visual data.\n",
    " \n",
    "By the end of this cookbook, you will have a robust understanding of how to implement RAG systems capable of processing and interpreting documents with complex visual elements. This knowledge will empower you to build AI solutions that deliver richer, more accurate information, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.\n",

    "### 1. Setting up a Vector Store with Pinecone \n",
    "In this section, we'll set up a vector store using Pinecone to store and manage our embeddings efficiently. Pinecone is a powerful vector database optimized for handling high-dimensional vector data, which is essential for tasks like semantic search and similarity matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites** \n",
    "Sign-up for Pinecone and obtain an API key by following the instructions here [Pinecone Database Quickstart](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/quickstart)\n",
    "Install the Pinecone SDK using `pip install \"pinecone[grpc]\"`. gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language, and enables client-server communication in a distributed system. It is designed to make inter-service communication more efficient and suitable for microservices architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Storing the API Key Securely**\n",
    "Store the API key in an .env file for security purposes in you project directory as follows:  \n",
    " `PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`. Install `pip install python-dotenv` to read the API Key from the .env file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the Pinecone Index** \n",
    "We'll use the `create_index` function to initialize our embeddings database on Pinecone. There are two crucial parameters to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimension: This must match the dimensionality of the embeddings produced by your chosen model. For example, OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model produces embeddings with 1536 dimensions, while text-embedding-3-large produces embeddings with 3072 dimensions. We'll use the text-embedding-3-large model, so we'll set the dimension to 3072.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Metric: The distance metric determines how similarity is calculated between vectors. Pinecone supports several metrics, including cosine, dotproduct, and euclidean. For this cookbook, we'll use the cosine similarity metric. You can learn more about distance metrics in the [Pinecone Distance Metrics documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/indexes/understanding-indexes#distance-metrics).\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Parse the PDF into individual pages: We split the PDF into separate pages for easier processing.\n",
    "2. Convert PDF pages to images: This enabled vision GPT-4o vision capability to analyze the page as an image.  \n",
    "3. Process images and tables: Provide instructions to GPT-4o to extract text, and also describe the images or tables in the document. \n",

    "**1. Downloading and Chunking the PDF:**  \n",
    "- The `chunk_document` function downloads the PDF from the provided URL and splits it into individual pages using PyPDF2.\n",
    "- Each page is stored as a separate PDF byte stream in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Converting PDF Pages to Images:** \n",
    "- The `convert_page_to_image` function takes the PDF bytes of a single page and converts it into an image using pdf2image.\n",
    "- The image is saved locally in an 'images' directory for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Extracting Text Using OCR:**\n",
    "- The `extract_text_from_image` function uses GPT-4o vision capability to extract text from the image of the page.\n",
    "- This method can extract textual information even from scanned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Processing the Entire Document:** \n",
    "- The process_document function orchestrates the processing of each page.\n",
    "- It uses a progress bar (tqdm) to show the processing status.\n",
    "- The extracted information from each page is collected into a list and then converted into a Pandas DataFrame.\n"

IN FISCAL 2024, WE DID JUST THAT.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group adopted a bold new vision of a world free of poverty on a livable planet. To achieve this, the Bank Group is enacting reforms to become a better partner to governments, the private sector, and, ultimately, the people we serve. Rarely in our 80-year history has our work been more urgent: We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, mounting public debt, food insecurity, an unequal pandemic recovery, and the effects of geopolitical conflict.\\n\\nResponding to these intertwined challenges requires a faster, simpler, and more efficient World Bank Group. We are refocusing to confront these challenges not just through funding, but with knowledge. Our Knowledge Compact for Action, published in fiscal 2024, details how we will empower all Bank Group clients, public and private, by making our wealth of development knowledge more accessible. And we have reorganized the World Bank’s global practices into five Vice Presiding units—People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital—for more flexible and faster engagements with clients. Each of these units reached important milestones in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nWe are supporting countries in delivering quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030 so our children and grandchildren will lead healthier, better lives. This is part of our larger global effort to address a basic standard of care through every stage of a person’s life—infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. To help people withstand food-affected shocks and crises, we are strengthening social protection services to support half a billion people by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women.\\n\\nWe are helping developing countries create jobs and employment, the surest enablers of prosperity. In the next 10 years, 1.2 billion young people across the Global South will become working-age adults. Yet, in the same period and the same countries, only 424 million jobs are expected to be created. The cost of hundreds of millions of young people with no hope for a decent job or future is unimaginable, and we are working urgently to create opportunity for all.\\n\\nIn response to climate change—arguably the greatest challenge of our generation—we’re channeling 45 percent of annual financing to climate action by 2025, deployed equally between mitigation and adaptation. Among other efforts, we intend to launch at least 15 country-led methane-reduction programs by fiscal 2026, and our Forest Carbon Partnership Facility has helped strengthen high-integrity carbon markets.\\n\\nAccess to electricity is a fundamental human right and foundational to any successful development effort. It will accelerate the great struggle to uplift developing countries, strengthen public infrastructure, and prepare people for the jobs of tomorrow. But the population of Africa—600 million people—lacks access to electricity. In response, we have committed to provide electricity to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank.\\n\\nRecognizing that digitalization is the transformational opportunity of our time, we are collaborating with governments in more than 100 developing countries to enable digital economies. Our digital lending portfolio totaled $5.6 billion in commitments as of June 2024; and our new Digital Vice Presidency unit will afford us to establish the foundations of a digital economy. Key initiatives include building and enhancing digital and data infrastructure, ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy for institutions, businesses, and citizens, and advancing digital government services.\\n\\nDelivering on our commitments requires us to develop new and better ways of working. In fiscal 2024, we did just that. We are squeezing our balance sheet and finding new opportunities to take more risk and boost our lending. Our new crisis preparedness and response tools, Global Challenge Programs, and Livable Planet Fund demonstrate how we are amending our approach to better thrive and meet outcomes. Our new Scorecard radically changes how we track results.\\n\\nBut we cannot achieve development on our own. We need partners from both the public and private sectors to join our efforts. That’s why we are working closely with other multilateral development banks to improve the lives of people in developing countries in tangible, measurable ways. Our deepening relationship with the private sector is evidenced by our Private Sector Investment Lab, which is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets. The Lab’s core group of 15 Chief Executive Officers and Chairs meets regularly, and already has informed our work—most notably with the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nThe impact and innovations we delivered this year will allow us to move forward with a raised ambition and a greater sense of urgency to improve people’s lives. I would like to recognize the remarkable efforts of our staff and Executive Directors, as well as the unwavering support of all our clients and partners. Together, we head into fiscal 2025 with a great sense of optimism—and determination to create a better Bank for a better world.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA\\nPresident of the World Bank Group\\nand Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a group of people examining produce, likely in an agricultural context.

    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on transforming the textual content extracted from each page of the document into vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling efficient similarity searches and various NLP tasks. We also identify pages containing visual elements, such as images or tables, and flag them for special handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Adding a flag for visual content**   \n",
    "  \n",
    "To address pages with visual information, we used the vision modality to extract content from charts, tables, and images. Using specific instructions, we tag the extracted text and flag pages containing visual content. Although the vision model effectively captures much of the visual data, some nuances may be lost in translation. This is especially true for complex visuals such as engineering drawings. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a semantic search retrieves a page flagged for visual content, we use this tag to pass the original page as input to the model for Retrieval-Augmented Content Generation. A simple lambda function checks if `PageText` contains markers like `DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART` or `TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE`. If a marker is detected, the flag is set to 'Y'; otherwise, it's 'N'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this flag to identify pages that images, charts or tables, so it can be passed to the model as vision modality input. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Generating Embeddings with OpenAI's Embedding Model**  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use OpenAI's embedding model, `text-embedding-3-large`, to generate high-dimensional embeddings that represent the semantic content of each page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is crucial to ensure that the dimensions of the embedding model you use are consistent with the configuration of your Pinecone vector store. In our case, we set up the Pinecone database with 3072 dimensions to match the default dimensions of `text-embedding-3-large`.  \n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we embarked on a journey to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for documents rich in images, graphics and tables. Traditional RAG models, while proficient with textual data, often overlook the wealth of information conveyed through visual elements. By integrating vision models and leveraging metadata tagging, we've bridged this gap, enabling AI to interpret and utilize visual content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by setting up a vector store using Pinecone, establishing a foundation for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. Parsing PDFs and extracting visual information allowed us to convert document pages into images and identify those containing crucial visual data. By generating embeddings and flagging pages with visual content, we created a robust metadata filtering system within our vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uploading these embeddings to Pinecone facilitated seamless integration with our RAG system. Through semantic search, we retrieved relevant pages that matched user queries, ensuring that both textual and visual information were considered. Handling pages with visual content by passing them to vision models enhanced the accuracy and depth of the responses, particularly for queries dependent on images or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the World Bank's **A Better Bank for a Better World: Annual Report 2024** as our guiding example, we demonstrated how these techniques come together to process and interpret complex documents. This approach not only enriches the information provided to users but also significantly enhances user satisfaction and engagement by delivering more comprehensive and accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the concepts outlined in this cookbook, you are now equipped to build RAG systems capable of processing and interpreting documents with intricate visual elements. This advancement opens up new possibilities for AI applications across various domains where visual data plays a pivotal role."
