    "## Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Documents with Integrated Images, Graphics and Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents unique challenges when working with documents rich in images and tables. Traditional RAG models excel with textual data but often falter when visual elements play a crucial role in conveying information. In this cookbook, we bridge that gap by leveraging vision models to extract and interpret visual content, ensuring that the generated responses are as informative and accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves parsing documents into images and utilizing metadata tagging to identify pages containing images or tables. When a semantic search retrieves such a page, we pass the page image to a vision model instead of relying solely on text. This method enhances the model's ability to understand and answer user queries that pertain to visual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we will explore and demonstrate the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Setting Up a Vector Store with Pinecone:\n",
    "- Learn how to initialize and configure Pinecone to store vector embeddings efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Parsing PDFs and Extracting Visual Information:\n",
    "- Discover techniques for converting PDF pages into images.\n",
    "- Use vision models to detect pages with images or tables and extract pertinent information.\n",
    "- Extract the information from images and tables to enable semantic search. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Generating Embeddings: \n",
    "- Flag the pages that have visual content so we can use this to setup meta-data filters on vector store. \n",
    "- Utilize embedding models to create vector representations of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Uploading embeddings to Pinecone: \n",
    "- Upload these embeddings to Pinecone for seamless storage and retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Performing Semantic Search for Relevant Pages:\n",
    "- Implement semantic search to find pages that best match the user's query. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Handling Pages with Visual Content:\n",
    "- When metadata indicates the presence of an image or table, learn how to pass the image to a vision model for question answering for additional context. \n",
    "- Understand how this process improves the accuracy of responses involving visual data.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "By the end of this cookbook, you will have a robust understanding of how to implement RAG systems capable of processing and interpreting documents with complex visual elements. This knowledge will empower you to build AI solutions that deliver richer, more accurate information, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.\n",

    "### 1. Setting up a Vector Store with Pinecone \n",
    "In this section, we'll set up a vector store using Pinecone to store and manage our embeddings efficiently. Pinecone is a powerful vector database optimized for handling high-dimensional vector data, which is essential for tasks like semantic search and similarity matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites** \n",
    "Sign-up for Pinecone and obtain an API key by following the instructions here [Pinecone Database Quickstart](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/quickstart)\n",
    "Install the Pinecone SDK using `pip install \"pinecone[grpc]\"`. gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language, and enables client-server communication in a distributed system. It is designed to make inter-service communication more efficient and suitable for microservices architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Storing the API Key Securely**\n",
    "Store the API key in an .env file for security purposes in you project directory as follows:  \n",
    " `PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`. Install `pip install python-dotenv` to read the API Key from the .env file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the Pinecone Index** \n",
    "We'll use the `create_index` function to initialize our embeddings database on Pinecone. There are two crucial parameters to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimension: This must match the dimensionality of the embeddings produced by your chosen model. For example, OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model produces embeddings with 1536 dimensions, while text-embedding-3-large produces embeddings with 3072 dimensions. We'll use the text-embedding-3-large model, so we'll set the dimension to 3072.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Metric: The distance metric determines how similarity is calculated between vectors. Pinecone supports several metrics, including cosine, dotproduct, and euclidean. For this cookbook, we'll use the cosine similarity metric. You can learn more about distance metrics in the [Pinecone Distance Metrics documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/indexes/understanding-indexes#distance-metrics).\n"

    "**Steps Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Downloading and Chunking the PDF:**  \n",
    "- The `chunk_document` function downloads the PDF from the provided URL and splits it into individual pages using PyPDF2.\n",
    "- Each page is stored as a separate PDF byte stream in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Converting PDF Pages to Images:** \n",
    "- The `convert_page_to_image` function takes the PDF bytes of a single page and converts it into an image using pdf2image.\n",
    "- The image is saved locally in an 'images' directory for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Extracting Text Using OCR:**\n",
    "- The `extract_text_from_image` function uses GPT-4o vision capability to extract text from the image of the page.\n",
    "- This method can extract textual information even from scanned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Processing the Entire Document:** \n",
    "- The process_document function orchestrates the processing of each page.\n",
    "- It uses a progress bar (tqdm) to show the processing status.\n",
    "- The extracted information from each page is collected into a list and then converted into a Pandas DataFrame.\n"

IN FISCAL 2024, WE DID JUST THAT.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group adopted a bold new vision of a world free of poverty on a livable planet. To achieve this, the Bank Group is enacting reforms to become a better partner to governments, the private sector, and, ultimately, the people we serve. Rarely in our 80-year history has our work been more urgent: We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, mounting public debt, food insecurity, an unequal pandemic recovery, and the effects of geopolitical conflict.\\n\\nResponding to these intertwined challenges requires a faster, simpler, and more efficient World Bank Group. We are refocusing to confront these challenges not just through funding, but with knowledge. Our Knowledge Compact for Action, published in fiscal 2024, details how we will empower all Bank Group clients, public and private, by making our wealth of development knowledge more accessible. And we have reorganized the World Bank’s global practices into five Vice Presidency units—People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital—for more flexible and faster engagements with clients. Each of these units reached important milestones in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nWe are supporting countries in delivering quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030 so our children and grandchildren will lead healthier, better lives. This is part of our larger global effort to provide a basic standard of care through every stage of a person’s life—infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. To help people withstand food-affected shocks and crises, we are strengthening social protection services to support half a billion people by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women.\\n\\nWe are helping developing countries create jobs and employment, the surest enablers of prosperity. In the next 10 years, 1.2 billion young people across the Global South will become working-age adults. Yet, in the same period and the same countries, only 424 million jobs are expected to be created. The cost of hundreds of millions of young people with no hope for a decent job or future is unimaginable, and we are working urgently to create opportunity for all.\\n\\nIn response to climate change—arguably the greatest challenge of our generation—we’re channeling 45 percent of annual financing to climate action by 2025, deployed equally between mitigation and adaptation. Among other efforts, we intend to launch at least 15 country-led methane-reduction programs by fiscal 2026, and our Forest Carbon Partnership Facility has helped strengthen high-integrity carbon markets.\\n\\nAccess to electricity is a fundamental human right and foundational to any successful development effort. It will accelerate the industrialization of developing countries, strengthen public infrastructure, and prepare people for the jobs of tomorrow. But for the population of Africa—600 million people—lacks access to electricity. In response, we have committed to provide electricity to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank.\\n\\nRecognizing that digitalization is the transformational opportunity of our time, we are collaborating with governments in more than 100 developing countries to enable digital economies. Our digital lending portfolio totaled $56.6 billion in commitments as of June 2024; and our new Digital Vice Presidency unit will lead our efforts to establish the foundations of a digital economy. Key initiatives include building and enhancing digital and data infrastructure, ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy for institutions, businesses, and citizens, and advancing digital government services.\\n\\nDelivering on our commitments requires us to develop new and better ways of working. In fiscal 2024, we did just that. We are squeezing our balance sheet and finding new opportunities to take more risk and boost our lending. Our new crisis preparedness and response tools, Global Challenge Programs, and Livable Planet Fund demonstrate how we are modernizing our approach to better survive and meet outcomes. Our new Scorecard radically changes how we track results.\\n\\nBut we cannot achieve development on our own. We need partners from both the public and private sectors to join our efforts. That’s why we are working closely with other multilateral development banks to improve the lives of people in developing countries in tangible, measurable ways. Our deepening relationship with the private sector is evidenced by our Private Sector Investment Lab, which is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets. The Lab’s core group of 15 Chief Executive Officers and Chairs meets regularly, and already has informed our work—most notably with the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nThe impact and innovations we delivered this year will allow us to move forward with a raised ambition and a greater sense of urgency to improve people’s lives. I would like to recognize the remarkable efforts of our staff and Executive Directors, as well as the unwavering support of our clients and partners. Together, we head into fiscal 2025 with a great sense of optimism—and determination to create a better Bank for a better world.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA  \\nPresident of the World Bank Group and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image on the right shows a group of people interacting with each other outdoors.

These operational enhancements are both timely and necessary. While economic growth prospects for the near term have improved slightly, easing fears of a global recession, the post-pandemic recovery remains weak in many developing countries, and pre-existing social stresses endure. The world is increasingly unlikely to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, amid climate change, biodiversity loss, and escalating geopolitical tensions further threatening development. To help countries address their intertwined challenges, the World Bank Group committed $117.5 billion (including $37.6 billion from IBRD, $34.7 billion from IFC, $2.8 billion from MIGA, and $38.9 billion in recipient-executed disbursing activities) in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nThe 2023 Annual Meetings marked an important milestone for the World Bank Group as Development Committee members endorsed the institution’s new vision of a world free of poverty on a livable planet. Since then, the Bank Group has implemented core reforms to build a better Bank, including enhancing its financial capacity; reinforcing its effectiveness and results; and improving operational and financial efficiency. The Bank Group has also developed a new Secured and crisis preparedness and response tools; launched the Global Challenge Programs and World Bank Group Guarantee Platform; developed a Knowledge Compact; forged four new partnerships (with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank); and streamlined the implementation of the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework.\\n\\nExecutive Directors commend the Bank Group’s commitment to devote 45 percent of annual financing to climate action by 2025, deployed equally between mitigation and adaptation. IFC and MIGA will intensify efforts to boost private sector financing for climate adaptation. Executive Directors also applaud the Bank Group’s 2030 commitments to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Africa in partnership with the African Development Bank and to provide quality, affordable healthcare to 1.5 billion people.\\n\\nThe Bank Group is enhancing its financing model to increase support for developing countries in low-income countries. Since the 2023 Annual Meetings, the Bank Group has raised funds for the IDA (crisis fund) and maintained IDA’s financial capacity of $30 billion per year for fiscal 2024 and 2025. Bank Group management has proposed commitments to IDA’s Capital Adequacy Framework that are expected to expand IDA’s financing by $20 billion through fiscal 2037. Executive Directors anticipate the funding generated by these measures, coupled with strong donor contributions for the December 2024 IDA replenishment, will improve lives and equip nations to tackle immediate crises and long-term development goals. Beyond financing, achieving these goals requires the unwavering commitment of current and new donors, client countries, and the World Bank.\\n\\nIBRD has made significant progress in enhancing its financial capacity while continuing to protect its triple-A rating and long-term financial stability. New financial instruments—such as hybrid capital, a portfolio guarantee platform, and the Livable Planet Fund—have been approved, and contributions have already been pledged by some Bank Group shareholders. The Board recently approved the Framework for Financial Intermediaries, which will encourage IBRD countries to boost investments in global challenges such as cross-border impact. Progress has been made toward enhancing the value of callable capital. In addition, IFC and MIGA are expanding their investment and guarantee offerings, including new instruments to mobilize private capital. Executive Directors look forward to the further operationalization of the Crisis Loss and Damage Fund, which is expected to be a significant resource in assisting developing nations affected by natural disasters linked to climate change.\\n\\nExecutive Directors welcome the Bank Group’s deepening partnerships with multilateral development banks and the private sector. The One World Bank Group Partnership Charter, published in May 2024, highlights the principles that define our work with partners and restates our vision of the partner we aspire to be. The Private Sector Investment Lab, launched in June 2023, is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets.\\n\\nThrough travel to several client countries this year, Executive Directors witnessed the Bank Group’s impact firsthand. During visits to Saudi Arabia (December 2023); China, Fiji, and Suriname (January-February 2024); Kazakhstan; Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan (March 2024); and Kenya and Ecuador (May 2024), Board members engaged with key government officials, private sector representatives, Bank Group staff, beneficiaries of Bank Group operations, donors, and other pertinent stakeholders.\\n\\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, the Executive Directors and management remain committed to sharpening the Bank Group’s approach to better serve people in low-income countries. The Executive Directors extend heartfelt tribute to Ajay Banga for his leadership in spearheading the evolution of the Bank Group, and sincerely thank all staff across the institution for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to the mission of ending poverty on a livable planet.\\n\\nFront row (left to right): Parameswaran Iyer, India; Abdullah Al Mulla, Kuwait; Ernesto Acevedo, Mexico; Felipe Gordoa, United States (Alternate Executive Director); Will Greenman, United Kingdom; Matteo Bugamelli, Italy (Dean); Junbong Chang, China (Co-Dean); Dominique Favre, Switzerland; Agondo Didiza, South Africa; Abdul Salam Bello, Niger; Arnaud Buisse, France\\n\\nBack row (left to right): Daniel Parlier, Argentine; Lene Lind, Norway; Katherine Reiche, Canada; Suhail Sedi, Saudi Arabia; Michael Krake, Germany; Marcos Chlestos, Brazil; Hideaki Imamura, Japan; Herbert Ngobiura, Burundi; T.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nBECOMING A BETTER BANK\\n\\nThe world is confronting a set of intertwined challenges—poverty, the climate crisis, debt, food insecurity, pandemics, and fragility—and a need to accelerate access to clean air, energy, and water. Time is of the essence.\\n\\nWe need a better Bank to address these challenges and the challenges of tomorrow.\\n\\nThe G20 Leaders requested the World Bank Group to change and be a more significant part of the solution. In response, we raised our ambition for speed, simplicity, better leveraging our balance sheet, and engaging partners and the private sector. Here's how we are enhancing our approach:\\n\\nFINANCIAL INNOVATIONS\\nOur new financial instruments are designed to boost lending capacity and enable the World Bank Group to take on more risk for shared global challenges. We've squeezed $40 billion over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan-to-equity ratio. We've launched a hybrid-capital instrument. Our Livable Planet Fund, launched in April 2024, offers governments, philanthropies, and other partners an opportunity to contribute to our concessional resources for middle-income countries.\\n\\nPRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT LAB\\nThe Private Sector Investment Lab is a collaborative initiative between the World Bank Group and directors of leading global private sector institutions. Its goal is to develop solutions that address existing barriers to private sector investment in emerging markets and developing economies. The Lab's core group of 15 CEOs and Chairs have delivered recommendations on regulatory certainty, increased use of guarantees, foreign-exchange-risk mitigation, and increased use of originate-to-distribute models for mobilization of private capital. Their feedback has already informed the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nWORLD BANK GROUP GUARANTEE PLATFORM\\nThis new platform is delivering simplicity and improved access to our guarantee products, putting us on a path to boost our annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030—and multiply our mobilization of private capital many times.\\n\\nGLOBAL EMERGING MARKETS RISK DATABASE (GEMS) CONSORTIUM\\nThe GEMs Consortium comprises 25 multilateral development banks and development finance institutions. The World Bank Group and the GEMs Consortium are driving transparency and mobilizing private investment in emerging markets by releasing comprehensive credit risk data.\\n\\nWORLD BANK GROUP SCORECARD\\nAccountability and focus underpin all our work. Our new Scorecard is a yardstick of accountability and a cornerstone of our efforts for greater efficiency, impact, and results. This tool allows our shareholders and taxpayers to clearly see the impact we are making, rewarding their trust.\\n\\nCRISIS PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE TOOLKIT\\nThe World Bank Group is rolling out an expanded Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit to help developing countries better respond to crises and build resilience against future shocks. Climate Resilient Debt Clauses will allow small states to prioritize disaster recovery over debt repayment when catastrophes hit.\\n\\nKNOWLEDGE BANK\\nKnowledge has been critical to the World Bank Group for 80 years, and we are refocusing ourselves not just as a funding mechanism, but also as a source of knowledge. To do this, we are bringing experts to the forefront of our country-driven model, working with governments to craft focused development plans that marry their ambition and our expertise. The Knowledge Compact for Action details this approach, and we focus on four areas: new and updated knowledge products, strategic partnerships, enhanced learning, and cutting-edge systems.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe page contains several images depicting various activities and initiatives related to banking and finance. These include photos of people in different professional settings, infrastructure, and digital interfaces, representing themes discussed in the text such as financial innovations, private sector investment, and knowledge sharing.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $15.6 billion for 96 operations in the region, including $2.9 billion in IBRD commitments and $12.7 billion in IDA commitments. We also leveraged data and analytics to help countries in the region reach their development potential.\\n\\nImproving education and health services\\nIn fiscal 2024, we approved the East Africa Girls’ Empowerment and Resilience Program to support more than 2 million girls to stay in or return to school and enable 160,000 women to increase their productivity in the labor market in Mozambique and Madagascar. The program is expected to reach more than 6 million people—including traditional leaders, parents, and other boys—through behavioral change and will enhance the capacity of 26,000 local administrators, community leaders, and service providers to implement gender equality reforms.\\n\\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are increasing access to education, particularly for girls, and improving teaching-learning conditions at secondary schools in selected provinces. This includes creating safe and inclusive school environments, strengthening curriculum and educational materials, as well as equipping girls and boys with digital skills. In Tanzania, our results-based financing education program led to 1.6 million students enrolling in preprimary and primary schools.\\n\\nTo improve school attendance in Ethiopia, we are equipping more than 5,000 schools with essential water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities and\\n\\nExpanding access to electricity across Rwanda\\nThe World Bank Group and the African Development Bank have committed to provide electricity to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. Together, we aim to help countries across Sub-Saharan Africa expand energy access while addressing climate change.\\n\\nRwanda, which has expanded electricity access from 6 percent in 2009 to more than 75 percent as of March 2024, is leading the way. One hundred percent of its health centers and administrative facilities and 84 percent of its schools now have electricity.\\n\\nThe Government of Rwanda laid the foundation for this remarkable progress in 2008, when it engrained electrification targets in its national strategies and set up the Electricity Access Rollout Program to implement these targets.\\n\\nThe World Bank accelerated progress by initiating $475 million in Development-Policy Operations loans, with Rwanda implementing comprehensive energy sector policies that resulted in improvements to the legal and fiscal responsivity, including tariff reforms, geo-spatial planning, increased electrification, and strategies to promote off-grid electrification. As a result, Rwanda’s demand-induced electricity sector subsidies are below 1.4 percent of GDP while aggressively expanding electrification.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 2: EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022-24\\n\\n|       | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\\n|       | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n| IBRD  | 2,907  | 2,364  | 2,914  | 2,441  | 1,690  | 3,126  |\\n| IDA   | 15,266 | 14,368 | 12,735 | 7,133  | 10,417 | 10,696 |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $78.8 billion.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows several people standing on a pavement, appearing to be using mobile phones or interacting with each other.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $11 billion for 66 operations in the region, comprising $1.7 billion in IBRD commitments and $9.3 billion in IDA commitments. About half of these commitments went to countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence.\\n\\n*Empowering women through education and health services*\\nOur projects have enabled an additional 1.8 million girls to enroll in secondary education across the region, laying the foundation for future economic growth. To build on these results, we approved additional financing of $700 million to scale the Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment in Nigeria. We aim to reach 8.6 million girls through the program and more than 250,000 eligible girls have received scholarships to date. In Senegal, the $75 million Investing in Early Years for Human Development Project has benefited 14 million mothers and children through a range of early childhood interventions and essential nutrition services. It also increased birth registrations from 43 percent in 2018 to 73 percent in 2023.\\n\\n*Boosting food security and climate resilience*\\nWe provided emergency food assistance for 3.4 million people and agricultural support to 11 million farmers in the region. Through the West Africa Food System Resilience Program, more than 1.6 million farmers are receiving climate-smart agricultural training, helping them increase yields and reduce losses. We established national food reserves in 12 countries and supported 5 regional centers of excellence to strengthen the food security value chain.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE:**\\n\\nThe image shows a woman standing in front of a window with colorful curtains.

The park will supply electricity to 250,000 people in the capital of Bangui, almost doubling the country’s electricity generation capacity. It will replace over 90 percent of the energy currently produced by diesel fuel, while generating more than $4 million per year for the National Electricity Company. It will also contribute to a net reduction of emissions of around 670,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂).\\n\\nIn Nigeria, more than 17.5 million Nigerians, or 20 percent of the currently unserved population, will benefit from our Nigeria Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-Up Project, which will replace more than 280,000 polluting and expensive fossil-fueled generator sets with standalone solar. In addition, we are completing the 225-kilovolt transmission line of the Gambia River Basin Development Organization to connect The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal through 15 substations, such as the Tambacounda power station.\\n\\nThese projects, and many more like them, laid the foundation for the Bank Group’s commitment to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank.</td>\n",

But using VnSAT techniques, GHG emissions from about 180,000 hectares of rice land were reduced by approximately 1.5 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year compared with traditional farming. The project enabled 150,000 rice farmers to improve their average profit per hectare by about 30 percent, compared with households outside the project.\\n\\nThe success of the VnSAT program provides lessons for other agricultural sectors, including coffee, livestock, and fisheries, and its techniques are ready to be applied in other rice-growing areas. In China, which contributes about 30 percent of the world’s rice production, the Methane-Reducing and Water-Saving Paddy Rice Program aims to reduce methane emissions, improve irrigation and drainage services, and provide agricultural support for climate-resilient rice production in Hunan province, China’s largest rice production area.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 6: EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC**\\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022-24\\n\\n|          | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\\n|          | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n| IBRD     | 5,482  | 6,636  | 6,788  | 5,439  | 4,350  | 5,492  |\\n| IDA      | 1,673  | 877    | 1,238  | 1,502  | 1,448  | 1,015  |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $32.7 billion.</td>\n",

We approved the Europe and Central Asia Renewable Energy Scale-up Program with the aim of adding 15 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, reducing 240 million metric tons of carbon emissions, and creating more than 90,000 renewable energy jobs. Türkiye, the first country to borrow through this program, is expanding its municipal solar energy market for businesses and households and piloting distributed battery storage technology.\\n\\nAcross Central Asia, we are benefiting 50,000 people by restoring transboundary landscapes through the Resilient Landscape Restoration Project. In the Kyrgyz Republic, we are promoting sustainable development by improving water access for 200,000 people in 94 villages and helping to restore rural landscapes. We also published Country Climate and Development Reports for Azerbaijan, Romania, and Uzbekistan. The recommendations in these reports have informed sustainable development policy dialogues and operations.\\n\\nEnhancing economic prosperity and job creation  \\nWe support reforms and investments focused on private sector-led growth and job creation. Our development policy loans and other operations create markets by improving competition regulation, enhancing the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, and removing disputes in finance. In Kosovo, our Effectiveness, Competitiveness, and Green Growth Development Policy Financing is enabling job creation and a cleaner environment. In Kazakhstan, we are extending the research and development ecosystem to drive innovation and create jobs through the Fostering Productive Innovation Project.\\n\\nCOUNTRY IMPACT\\n\\nTajikistan: Nearly 3 million people have directly benefited from our resilience-building projects spanning agribusiness, childhood immunizations, and disaster risk management.\\n\\nTürkiye: Our low-carbon development strategies could reduce carbon emissions by 70 percent, yielding $146 billion in economic opportunity (or 1 percent of GDP) by 2040.\\n\\nUkraine: We have helped more than 13 million people receive timely payments of pensions and social assistance, alongside the continued provision of critical health, education, and other essential services.\\n\\nImproving physical and digital connectivity  \\nOur research shows that with the right investment and policies, a transport route across the Middle Trade and Transport Corridor countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus could triple trade volumes while halving travel time by 2030. To expand digital infrastructure, we allocated additional financing for the Digital Central Asia South Asia Project which provides internet access for more than 800,000 people in the Kyrgyz Republic. The project is increasing internet penetration to 57 percent of the country, attracting private investment and improving digital government services.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/eca.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\n**FIGURE 4: EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA IBRD AND IDA LENDING BY SECTOR - FISCAL 2024 SHARE OF TOTAL OF $10.4 BILLION**\\n\\nA pie chart dividing sectors for lending:  \\n- Energy and Extractives: 19%  \\n- Financial Sector: 14%  \\n- Public Administration: 18%  \\n- Social Protection: 25%  \\n- Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management: 11%  \\n- Transportation: 2%  \\n- Education: 1%  \\n- Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry: 5%  \\n- Health: 4%  \\n- Information and Communications Technologies: 3%  \\n- Industry, Trade, and Services: 9%  \\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 9: EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA REGIONAL SNAPSHOT**\\n\\n| INDICATOR                                         | 2000  | 2012  | CURRENT DATAa |\\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------------|\\n| Total population (millions)                       | 216.0 | 232.7 | 247.5         |\\n| Population growth (annual %)                      | 0.4   | 0.8   | 0.2           |\\n| GNI per capita (Atlas method, current US$)        | 1,874.3 | 6,825.7 | 7,691.9      |\\n| GDP per capita growth (annual %)                  | 6.4   | 3.2   | 4.4           |\\n| Population living below $2.15 a day (millions)    | 43.3  | 4.2   | 2.3           |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, females (years)         | 73.0  | 76.2  | 77.6          |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, males (years)           | 65.0  | 69.0  | 70.7          |\\n| Carbon dioxide emissions (megatons)               | 2,577.2 | 2,595.7 | 2,830.7      |\\n| Extreme poverty (% of population below $2.15 a day, 2007 PPP) | 9.2   | 0.9   | 0.5           |\\n| Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods, services, and primary income | 18.9  | 14.9  | 17.8          |\\n| Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%) (modeled ILO estimate) | 68.2  | 67.2  | 64.7          |\\n| Vulnerable employment, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) | 33.7  | 30.2  | 29.0          |\\n| Under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births      | 42.8  | 19.7  | 13.1          |\\n| Primary completion rate (% of relevant age group) | 95.9  | 97.5  | 99.8          |\\n| Individuals using the internet (% of population)  | 1.7   | 39.5  | 81.0          |\\n| Access to electricity (% of population)           | 99.0  | 99.7  | 100.0         |\\n| Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) | 7.6   | 7.5   | 10.1          |\\n| People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) | 91.3  | 93.5  | 95.6          |\\n| People using at least basic sanitation services (% of population)  | 89.9  | 94.9  | 97.8          |\\n\\nNote: ILO = International Labour Organization, PPP = purchasing power parity.  \\na.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $9.7 billion for 52 operations in the region, including $9.4 billion in IBRD commitments and $269 million in IDA commitments. We signed 14 Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements** with five countries for a total of $13.2 million.\\n\\nTABLE 10: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $33.5 billion.\\n\\nImproving education and health services  \\nIn the last decade, nearly 13 million people across the region have benefited from our 40 education projects totaling $5 billion in commitments. In Guyana, projects totaling $90 million are tackling inequalities at all educational levels to meet new and growing labor market demands. Over 7,000 secondary students have benefited so far, and more than 1,000 teachers have received training. Our Learning can’t wait: Lessons for Latin America and the Caribbean from PISA 2022 report, produced jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank, tackles the learning crisis affecting adolescents in the region, one of the most severe educational crises in the last 100 years.\\n\\nIn Chile, we are expanding access to primary health services through a $200 million project. And in the Dominican Republic, a $150 million project seeks to improve the quality of public healthcare services provision, especially for maternal and neonatal care, and to strengthen health and social assistance systems. Our Health at a Glance: Latin America and the Caribbean report analyzed the climate resilience of health systems in 11 countries across the region.\\n\\nInnovating for a greener future in Uruguay and Chile  \\nWith support from the World Bank, Uruguay has become a pioneer in the development of financial instruments to address climate change. In November 2023, we approved a $350 million loan for Uruguay, as part of the Environmental Goal-Driven Financing Mechanism, that marks a global first by linking multilateral development bank financing conditions with the achievement of ambitious environmental targets. Uruguay could see a reduction of up to $12.5 million in interest on this loan if it attains a verifiable decrease in the intensity of methane gas emissions from livestock production.\\n\\nIn Chile, which is rich in renewable resources, we have approved a $150 million investment to promote in-country green hydrogen projects. This is our first loan to promote green hydrogen to support climate change mitigation efforts. Chile expects to produce the lowest-cost hydrogen in the world by 2030 and to be among the world’s top three hydrogen exporters by 2040.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows two people wearing hard hats and safety vests inside an industrial setting.

Our Regional Gender Action Plan (2021–2025) sets out an approach to narrow persistent gender gaps in the country level. In Ecuador, we approved a $500 million loan to foster inclusive and sustainable development by protecting the most vulnerable and supporting gender equality in all economic sectors.\\n\\nFostering climate resilience and a green transition  \\nWe are bolstering the region’s resilience to climate change and helping countries advance their energy transition agendas. In Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, the Global Program for Resilient Housing identifies houses vulnerable to natural disasters, determines which ones can be made safer before it is too late, and connects the homeowners with government subsidies and private capital. In Peru, two projects totaling $1.5 billion are supporting climate change adaptation and a greener economy. In Panama, we are supporting reforms to enable the energy transition and inclusive low-carbon growth, benefiting the most vulnerable populations. And in Colombia, a $750 million loan to support equitable growth also aims to protect wildlife and reduce deforestation. In fiscal 2024, we published Country Climate and Development Reports with recommendations for sustainable development for Colombia and the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nPromoting formalization of entrepreneurs  \\nIn Ecuador, the Inclusive and Sustainable Growth Program has supported the introduction of a new type of company modality in the legal framework. The new simplified corporation form, S.A.S., has become the most popular vehicle for starting a business in Ecuador. As of fiscal 2022, more than 58,700 S.A.S.s have been registered in the country, representing approximately 80 percent of total companies. This success is replicated in El Salvador, with over 800 companies registered during the first five months of implementation of the S.A.S. this year, and 1,821 registration processes initiated online.\\n\\nCollaborating for sustainable prosperity and digital development  \\nWith the Inter-American Development Bank, we have embarked on a first-ever, four-year partnership to better combat poverty, create jobs, and address climate change. We have committed to work jointly in three priority areas. In the Amazon, we will support countries in their transition to net zero deforestation; help improve the livelihoods of their inhabitants, mostly Indigenous Peoples; and preserve the ecosystem. In the Caribbean, we will focus on supporting disaster risks and climate-crisis management, as well as on developing mechanisms for financial protection against future shocks. We will also bridge the digital divide across the region by collaborating on digital infrastructure and rural connectivity, especially for education.\\n\\n**COUNTRY IMPACT**\\n\\nArgentina: Our flood protection measures have benefited more than 6 million people by safeguarding their communities and infrastructure.\\n\\nEcuador: We financed the fully electric Quito Metro Line, which is expected to annually reduce emissions by 57,000 tons of CO2 equivalent, and save $50 million in fuel costs.\\n\\nJamaica: Our emergency response and risk reduction projects have benefited 57 percent of the population since 2016, enhancing resilience and preparedness in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nFigure 8 illustrates the share of total spending, $9.7 billion, across various sectors in Latin America and the Caribbean for fiscal 2024.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $4.6 billion for 17 operations in the region, including $4.2 billion in IBRD commitments and $340 million in IDA commitments. An additional $87.5 million in special financing was approved for projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Revenue from Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements reached $41.5 million for strategic and technical assistance on sustainable social, economic, and environmental reforms.\\n\\nStrengthening human capital: Health, education, and social protection services\\nIn fiscal 2024, we continued to prioritize human capital development, including in countries experiencing fragility, conflict, or violence. In Yemen, we are enabling the delivery of essential health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene services through additional financing of $150 million for the Emergency Human Capital Project. Implemented by UN partners, this project is expected to benefit at least 19 million people, of whom 10 million are women and girls. We also approved an additional $150 million for the Emergency Social Protection Enhancement and COVID-19 Response Project in Yemen. This third round of financing will help millions of Yemenis as they address the chronic food insecurity and vulnerability exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, economic instability, and climate-related shocks.\\n\\nMobilizing emergency support in Morocco\\nIn September 2023, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck in the High Atlas Mountain range in Morocco, killing more than 2,900 people and affecting over 300,000 people in Marrakech and surrounding areas. The World Bank, which has a robust 65-year partnership with Morocco, reacted quickly to support the country's post-disaster response. We conducted a rapid assessment of the damage and supported the Government to quickly disburse funds to affected people through an insurance regime, the Solidarity Fund, that had been pre-arranged with our support prior to the disaster.\\n\\nOur lending portfolio in Morocco for disaster risk management and financing totals $580 million over the past five years. These funds have been instrumental in improving the institutional framework to scale up disaster risk reduction activities and strengthen financial resilience to natural disasters for the entire Moroccan population.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 12: MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\n|                   | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\\n|                   | FY22      FY23      FY24  | FY22      FY23      FY24    |\\n| IBRD              | 4,135     4,697     4,233 | 3,407     2,964     3,332   |\\n| IDA               | 817       561       340   | 559       552       587     |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June  30, 2024: $276 billion.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a group of people, including women and children, standing outdoors.

Working with the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the UN Children’s Fund, the grants support the delivery of emergency food, water, and medical supplies. In the West Bank, we approved a $13 million grant for the continuation of education for children, $22 million to support municipal services, and $45 million to strengthen healthcare and hospital services.\\n\\nEnabling green and inclusive growth\\nTo help policymakers in the region advance their climate change and development goals, we published Country Climate and Development Reports for the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, and Tunisia. In Libya, the catastrophic flooding in September 2023 devastated eastern localities, particularly the city of Derna. The World Bank, together with the UN and the European Union, produced a Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment to inform recovery and reconstruction efforts.\\n\\nWe signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Islamic Development Bank to promote further collaboration between our institutions. The MoU focuses on joint knowledge and operational engagements around the energy, food, and water nexus, climate impact, empowering women and youth to engage with the private sector, and advancing the digital transition and regional integration. The MoU aims to achieve a co-financing volume of $6 billion through 2026, 45 percent of which has already been met.\\n\\nExpanding economic opportunities for women\\nThe World Bank has drawn on a variety of instruments to support Jordan’s commitment to increase female labor force participation, including through the recently approved Country Partnership Framework. Through operations, technical assistance (such as Mashreq Gender Facility; Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative; and the Women, Business and the Law report), and policy dialogue, we have contributed to legal reforms in Jordan that removed job restrictions on women, prohibited gender-based discrimination in the workplace, and criminalized sexual harassment in the workplace. In fiscal 2024, we approved the first women-focused Bank project in the region: the Enhancing Women’s Economic Opportunities Program for Results aims to improve workplace conditions, increase financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, make public transport safer, and increase access to affordable, quality childcare services.\\n\\nAnalysing critical infrastructure needs\\nWe published an Interim Damage Assessment for Gaza in partnership with the UN and with financial support from the EU. This found that a preliminary estimate of the cost of damages to critical infrastructure from the conflict in Gaza between October 2023 and the end of January 2024 was around $18.5 billion—equivalent to 97 percent of the 2022 GDP of the West Bank and Gaza combined.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $9.4 billion for 35 operations in the region, including $3.2 billion in IBRD commitments and $6.2 billion in IDA commitments. We also supported 59 advisory services and analytical products for eight countries, totaling $62.8 million.\\n\\nBoosting water security for a climate-resilient future\\nOn average, 60 million people a year in South Asia have been affected by natural disasters since 2010. We are helping affected communities with investments that build resilience and improve productivity. In India, a new $300 million project will provide more and better access to water and sewer services to around 2 million people in 21 cities. In Bangladesh, we committed $102 million to support an economic corridor along the Jamuna River to enhance the livelihoods of residents and protect the unique ecosystem. In Pakistan, we committed just over $71 million in additional financing to continue supporting flood control and climate resilience in the highly vulnerable Sindh province, which bore the brunt of catastrophic floods in 2022. The Afghanistan Water Platform, which we co-chair with the UN, coordinates in-country humanitarian assistance and investments in water-related basic needs.\\n\\nCatalyzing India’s low-carbon energy transition\\nAs one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies, India is at a pivotal juncture in its development. While India’s per capita energy consumption is just one-third of the global average, its energy demand is expected to grow rapidly as the economy expands.\\n\\nIndia has set a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, a vision that requires a transformative shift to phase down fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is a core technological innovation that can shift energy-intensive sectors like cement, fertilizer, and steel to a low-carbon path. India aims to develop a green hydrogen industry to create jobs and boost energy security.\\n\\nThe World Bank is supporting this transition with two development policy operations worth $3 billion. This strategic financing is designed to catalyze India’s development of low-carbon energy across three interconnected areas: the emergence of a green hydrogen industry, the expansion of renewable energy, and the mobilization of climate finance.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 14: SOUTH ASIA  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\n|                | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |      | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |      |\\n|----------------|--------------------------|------|----------------------------|------|\\n|                | FY22                     | FY23 | FY24                       | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\n| IBRD           | 4,781                    | 3,143| 3,129                      | 3,192| 3,290| 4,381|\\n| IDA            | 4,217                    | 5,770| 6,239                      | 4,202| 4,646| 5,153|\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2023: $55.0 billion.</td>\n",

In Bangladesh, we have committed $300 million to improve the efficiency of gas distribution and reduce methane emissions along the natural gas value chain. In Pakistan, we committed $1 billion to support the completion of a large hydropower project as part of our broader support to renewable energy generation. In Nepal, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Asian Development Bank to strengthen the country’s hydropower sector through joint financing and advisory services. In Bhutan, we provided technical assistance to help establish rules and procedures for participation in carbon markets so the government can monetize emission reduction credits from hydropower and other renewable natural resources.\\n\\nEnabling jobs to foster equality, prosperity, and resilience\\n\\nSouth Asia is not creating enough jobs to keep pace with its rapidly growing working-age population. Our latest South Asia Development Update shows that private investment and robust growth of businesses and firms are essential to create the number and quality of jobs the region needs. To help close this gap, we are supporting countries through critical policy reforms, skills programs, and analytical work.\\n\\nFollowing the economic crises in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, we are supporting a series of reforms to put both countries on a more sustainable growth path by boosting competitiveness and laying the foundation for a private-sector-led recovery and job creation. A critical area of focus is on increasing women’s labor force participation as only one in four women in South Asia are currently in the workforce.\\n\\nCOUNTRY IMPACT\\n\\nBangladesh: With our support, girls now account for more than half of all secondary school enrollment and in the past six years, female labor force participation increased from 36 percent to 43 percent.\\n\\nMaldives: We are helping install 53.5 megawatts of solar panels on the islands and on the open ocean to create 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and upgrade the electricity grid to include cleaner energy sources.\\n\\nPakistan: We helped double revenue collection at the provincial level in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—from $99 million in fiscal 2019 to $216 million in fiscal 2022—through improved governance and fiscal management.\\n\\nWe also support inclusive skills programs to better prepare people for gainful employment. In Bangladesh, we provided $300 million to equip about 900,000 disadvantaged rural youth—many of whom are female—with skills, alternative education, entrepreneurship support, and employment opportunities. In India, we have committed $195 million to training, upskilling, and providing more than 300,000 people with jobs in high-growth sectors including renewable energy, information and technology services, and hospitality. We have also provided $74 million to India for a jobs-development project with leading private sector companies.\\n\\nFor Bhutan, whose increasingly educated workforce is emigrating at unprecedented rate, we published a report on the national labor market with recommendations to support private sector job creation.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe chart is a pie diagram titled “FIGURE 7: SOUTH ASIA IBRD AND IDA LENDING BY SECTOR · FISCAL 2024 SHARE OF TOTAL OF $9.4 BILLION.” It shows the distribution of lending by sector with percentages labeled around the chart, representing different categories: \\n\\n- Energy and Extractives: 28%\\n- Transportation: 16%\\n- Public Administration: 14%\\n- Information and Communications Technologies: 2%\\n- Industry, Trade, and Services: 6%\\n- Financial Sector: 6%\\n- Health: 7%\\n- Education: 8%\\n- Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry: 2%\\n- Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management: 5%\\n- Social Protection: 10%\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 15: SOUTH ASIA REGIONAL SNAPSHOT**\\n\\n| INDICATOR                                               | 2000   | 2012   | CURRENT DATAa |\\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\\n| Total population (millions)                             | 1,406.9| 1,708.7| 1,938.5       |\\n| Population growth (annual %)                            | 1.9    | 1.4    | 1.0           |\\n| GNI per capita (Atlas method, current US$)              | 442.1  | 1,383.5| 2,338.1       |\\n| GDP per capita growth (annual %)                        | 4.1    | 3.9    | 5.3           |\\n| Population living below $2.15 a day (millions)          | 590.3a | 394.8  | 186.9         |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, females (years)               | 63.9   | 69.5   | 70.1          |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, males (years)                 | 62.0   | 65.9   | 66.4          |\\n| Carbon dioxide emissions (megatons)                     | 1,073.0| 2,147.9| 2,518.4       |\\n| Extreme poverty (% of population below $2.15 a day, 2017 PPP) | 40.4a | 19.9   | 9.7           |\\n| Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods, services, and primary income | 4.1  | 7.4  | 9.9           |\\n| Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%) (modeled ILO estimate) | 35.1 | 34.4 | 41.4          |\\n| Vulnerable employment, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) | 79.6 | 75.3 | 69.9          |\\n| Under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births            | 93.5   | 57.0   | 35.9          |\\n| Primary completion rate (% of relevant age group)       | 67.5   | 84.2   | 99.3          |\\n| Individuals using the internet (% of population)        | 0.5    | 10.1   | 42.6          |\\n| Access to electricity (% of population)                 | 57.9   | 79.5   | 98.3          |\\n| Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) | 49.4 | 37.6 | 37.8          |\\n| People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) | 81.4 | 87.8  | 93.1          |\\n| People using at least basic sanitation services (% of population) | 17.8 | 49.1  | 75.5          |\\n\\nNote: ILO = International Labour Organization; PPP = purchasing power parity.\\n\\na.

We have earned and inherited decades of knowledge through our work, and this new structure makes it easier for us to share it with our clients. In the following section, we describe some of the ways our knowledge improved people’s lives in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nPEOPLE\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\n\\nWe are supporting health, education, and social protection services to improve people’s lives:\\n\\n- We are working alongside partners on social protection programs that reach 500 million people by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women.\\n\\n- As part of our global effort to achieve a shared ambition of care through every stage of a person’s life, we are helping countries deliver quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030.\\n\\n- Our active portfolio has improved schooling for 280 million students, and 137 million women and girls, as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\nHuman capital\\n\\nAs countries deal with multiple global crises, it’s even more important for them to invest in human capital—the knowledge, skills, and good health people need to achieve their potential. The World Bank’s Human Capital Project supports these efforts with a combination of research, data, analytics, and country and global engagement across 95 member economies. Our biannual ministerial conclaves in fiscal 2024 focused on creating more jobs through investing in human capital and on leveraging technology to improve human capital outcomes.\\n\\nOur report, How to Protect, Build, and Use Human Capital to Address Climate Change, recommended engaging leaders to engage people as agents for climate action. We also issued policy briefs on strengthening the links between human capital, gender, and climate.\\n\\nMany of our Bank clients and partners integrate human capital policies as they address crises amid shrinking economies.\\n\\nFinanced by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Canadian government, the Human Capital Umbrella Program provides a flexible financing model that allows donors and partners to support broader, more systematic institutional and policy reforms. Since 2019, it has supported clients in 46 countries in Africa and South Asia with critical investments and technical assistance to address human capital challenges. The program has informed more than 26 Bank operations totaling over $7 billion, reaching more than 57 million people.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a group of young children wearing blue shirts. They are gathered around a water source, and one child is holding a tap, from which water is flowing. The children are actively washing their hands under the running water.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSocial protection and labor systems\\nOver the last two decades we have built social protection programs that are helping more than 280 million poor and vulnerable people in 88 countries with effective social protection to withstand natural and man-made shocks that can exacerbate poverty and food insecurity.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we committed to work alongside partners to reach 500 million people with adaptive social protection by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women. To achieve this goal, we’re utilizing innovative digital cash transfer systems to help those in need receive resources directly and efficiently. Our strategy, The Compass, sets out our vision for universal social protection and guides our involvement, capacity, knowledge, and impact in delivering related programs.\\n\\nDespite progress, coverage gaps persist, necessitating better policies to protect and empower people amid demographic shifts, the green transition, and technological disruptions. In fiscal 2024, we committed an additional $5 billion for social protection, including $2.5 billion from IDA, bringing the total expected portfolio to $28.5 billion. We helped strengthen social registries and electronic payment systems in more than 50 countries and we improved food and nutrition security for 50 million poor and vulnerable households. We also helped communities build resilience against climate shocks and improve their livelihoods through income-generating opportunities.\\n\\nOur 105 jobs and skills training programs, active in 58 countries, empowered youth and women, and we assisted 76 countries to help manage their demographic transition through pension reforms and disability programs. We kickstarted 10 Global Skills Partnerships to support international labor mobility.\\n\\nHealth services\\nStrengthening health systems is essential to achieving progress on Universal Health Coverage (UHC). More than half the world’s population, about 4.5 billion people, lack access to essential health services according to our latest UHC Global Monitoring Report. More than 2 billion people face severe financial hardship paying out-of-pocket for those services.\\n\\nIn response, we have committed to help countries deliver quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030 as part of our global effort to provide a basic standard of care through every stage of a person’s life. The Bank, in partnership with the World Health Organization, is also supporting Japan to launch a UHC Knowledge Hub to enhance healthcare systems in developing countries.\\n\\nOur $29.4 billion global health portfolio includes 169 projects that improve health outcomes, especially for poor and vulnerable people, by strengthening UHC and public health. For example, a new regional health security program in Western and Central Africa is ramping up preparedness and response capacities for health emergencies for more than 620 million people.\\n\\nTo promote data and digital solutions in health systems, we published a report with strategic policy recommendations, Digital-in-Health: Unlocking the Value for Everyone. In response to the rising energy and health impacts of climate change in low- and middle-income countries, we announced a new Climate-Health Program in fiscal 2024 to help countries assess their climate and health vulnerabilities and increase partnerships and investments in climate-resilient health systems. To increase the impact of collective action, a Development Bank Working Group for Climate-Health Finance was established in July 2023 with 11 development banks. The group has already launched a joint roadmap to urgently scale climate and health action.\\n\\nTo improve the health of women, children and adolescents, the Global Financing Facility (GFF), a global country-led partnership hosted at the World Bank, continues to increase financing and technical assistance in GFF partner countries. As of June 2024, the GFF has committed a total of $1.5 billion for grants in 38 countries. Since partnering with the GFF, countries have reached 100 million pregnant women with access to four or more antenatal care visits; 130 million women with safe delivery care; and 630 million women and adolescents with modern contraceptives.\\n\\nTo boost resilience to future pandemics, the Pandemic Fund approved its first round of grants to 37 countries across six regions. In July 2024, the United States pledged up to $667 million, and Germany pledged $554 million to the Fund as it works toward raising at least $2 billion to meet strong demand from low- and middle-income countries. The Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Program Trust Fund allocated $139 million through June 2024 to support 43 country and regional efforts in health emergency preparedness and response. To mitigate the emerging threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we produced an AMR framework for action with recommendations for preventative actions in World Bank operations.\\n\\nEducation and training\\nA learning and skills crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic is hindering foundational learning and skills development, leaving young people unprepared for the workforce. In response, the World Bank is funding projects and research projects—including Education Finance Watch 2023, Building Better Formal TVET Systems: Making Teacher Policy Work, and the RAPID Framework for Learning Recovery to Acceleration—to enable improvements in education systems across the world.\\n\\nWe are the largest source of international financing for education with 149 projects totaling $26.1 billion. We are the largest international financier of education in fragility, conflict, and violence settings through $6.4 billion in active projects. Since 2015, we have managed 63 percent of all project implementation grants of the Global Partnership for Education, totaling $4.2 billion.\\n\\nWe work closely with partners to improve learning and education systems around the world. For example, we co-promote foundational learning through the Coalition for Foundational Learning and the Accelerator Program. The Early Learning Partnership multi-donor trust fund, housed at the World Bank, seeks to improve early learning opportunities and outcomes for young children. We also collaborate with the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel to inform education policies.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Scottish Government joined our foundational Learning Compact Trust Fund to support learning outcomes for children, with a particular focus on inclusive education. We also launched the Tertiary Education and Skills Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund with the Mastercard Foundation to improve access to inclusive, quality, equitable, and resilient education and training.\\n\\nAddressing learning poverty\\nStudents are attending educational institutions but not acquiring the skills they need to succeed in the job market. Officials often underestimate the severity of this crisis and don’t adapt their investment strategies accordingly. The World Bank Group has helped shift the focus from student enrollment to learning and has worked with partners to spur evidence-based action to improve learning. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank's active portfolio has improved educational opportunities for 280 million students, including 137 million women and girls.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nThe image contains a photo, likely of a healthcare or educational setting, showing individuals engaged in work activities.

In fiscal 2024, we:\\n\\n- Started a review with the IMF of the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries to better identify debt vulnerabilities and act before countries fall into debt distress.\\n\\n- Published country poverty and equity assessments that highlight the need to tackle poverty in all its dimensions, including through greater investments in human capital, agriculture, and rural development.\\n\\n- Convened the Private Sector Investment Lab which is working to address the barriers to greater private sector investment in emerging markets.\\n\\nPoverty alleviation\\nAround 700 million people live in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 per day. To help improve their lives, we provide policymakers with economic analyses and work with them to develop policy recommendations. Several of our country poverty and equity assessments in fiscal 2024 highlighted the need to tackle poverty in all its dimensions, including through greater investments in human capital, agriculture, and rural development. Our research assessed how countries can help vulnerable people adapt to risks and protect their welfare in the face of extreme weather events and other shocks. We are also helping countries improve their data for policymaking.\\n\\nWe work with partners to accelerate solutions to fight poverty. For example, we hosted a conference with the international movement ATD-Fourth World and the IMF to address the hidden dimensions of poverty. In partnership with the UN, we analyzed child-poverty trends and found that around 333 million children are living in extreme poverty. We also co-organized an Expert Group Meeting on Sustainable Development Goal 1 to create tangible policy guidance and practical actions to the 2024 UN High-level Political Forum.\\n\\nEconomic policies for growth and jobs\\nWeak revenue collection, higher levels of debt, and global interest rate hikes have pressured development expenditures in low-income countries. The World Bank has been one of the few financial lifelines to governments, especially those facing liquidity\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image on the right side shows a person working in an agricultural setting, wearing a headscarf and blue clothing, surrounded by greenery, possibly fruit trees.

We provide highly concessional financing and innovative financial solutions, including climate-resilient debt clauses and custom hedges. We also work with countries to strengthen their macroeconomic policy framework, mobilize more domestic revenues with equity, and build debt management capacity. To mitigate future debt risks, we have started, with the IMF, a review of the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries and launched a joint initiative to boost domestic resource mobilization.\\n\\nWe also play an active and constructive role in improving the global sovereign debt and tax architectures, working with stakeholders through the G20, the G20 Common Framework, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, and the OECD Platform for International Taxation. We support IDA countries to address debt vulnerabilities by strengthening debt and fiscal management through the complementary Sustainable Development Finance Policy.\\n\\nAs part of the Knowledge Compact, we started revamping our analytical products to better inform and increase the impact of our operations. We are piloting a new Public Finance Review, which now goes beyond public expenditures to analyze tax policies, and are upgrading the Country Economic Memorandum into the Growth and Jobs report to emphasize the urgency of creating more and better jobs across our client countries. Our work on economic modeling of climate change and tax policies to support the green transition also helps inform the Bank׳s climate change agenda.\\n\\nThe World Bank also publishes research and analysis to increase understanding of development policies, and programs. Our report, The Great Reversal: Prospects, Risks, and Policies in International Development Association Countries, offers the first comprehensive look at the opportunities and risks confronting the 75 countries eligible for IDA resources. Our International Debt Report is published annually, while the Global Economic Prospects report and The Commodity Markets Outlook are published twice a year.\\n\\nFinancial stabilisation\\nWe are helping governments improve the incentives for raising private capital for green investments and enhancing available information for investors interested in environmental objectives. This includes setting standards for sustainability-linked bonds.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we enhanced financing from the Access to Finance for Recovery and Resilience Project through the Government of Rwanda to provide a collateralized first-loss credit enhancement for the national development bank's bond issue. Instead of offering the typical line of credit, we worked with the government to deploy roughly a third of $297.5 million project funding as credit enhancements and enable the bonders from capital markets. This made it possible for private markets to finance small- and medium-sized enterprises. We have also financed risk capital to leverage private capital via Angola, Kenya, and Mozambique.\\n\\nWe continue to promote digital financial services as a driver of financial inclusion in developing economies, including through Project FASTT (Frictionless Affordable Safe Timely Transactions).\\n\\nStrong public institutions\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank continued to help countries strengthen their public institutions, i.e., core government functions. For example, we expanded our Climate Change Institutional Assessment series, updated the Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators database, and published the Government Analytics Handbook for public sector managers. We also launched an Anticorruption Lab and published a policy paper on Beneficial Ownership Registers.\\n\\nWe published an assessment of Liberia's judiciary (JUPITER) and are assessing the effectiveness of judiciaries in other countries. To promote the digitalization of government services, we published toolkits including Greening GovTech and GovTech in Fragile and Conflict Situations. We also published the Revenue Administration Handbook for policy makers and practitioners.\\n\\nThe Financial Management Umbrella Program and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Program, whose Secretariat is housed in the World Bank, continued to deliver results. In fiscal 2024, 30 PEFA assessments were completed. 11 of which involved the participation of World Bank teams. We also published the fourth Stocktaking of Public Financial Management Diagnostic Tools report.\\n\\nWith our client countries, we worked to mainstream gender considerations into fiscal policy and budget systems. In fiscal 2024, around $1.6 billion was mobilized through IBRD, IDA, and borrower co-financing to support Nigeria, Tanzania, and Togo in integrating gender considerations into their fiscal management systems. We are also advising the Democratic Republic of Congo, Grenada, Indonesia, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Ukraine on similar reforms. We continued supporting countries to improve public procurement policies and practices, and published a report, Drivers of Delays in Procurement of Infrastructure Projects.\\n\\nEnabling private investment\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank increased its support to client countries to enable business environments, strengthen private sector competitiveness, and promote the green transition of industries. Private investment plays a pivotal role in augmenting the productive capacity of economies, and creating more and better job opportunities, especially in IDA countries. In this context, Investment Climate Assessments and 2.0 diagnostics have been undertaken in nearly 20 countries, identifying and prioritizing policy reforms to unlock more private investment.\\n\\nOur Private Sector Investment Lab is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets. Since the Lab's launch in 2023, private sector leaders have provided the World Bank Group with valuable feedback that has helped us better align our strategies, with a view to increasing the speed and scale of private finance, ultimately leveraging more private capital for development.\\n\\nWe also launched The Business of the State report which proposes five key principles for effective government engagement with state-owned enterprises. Our work also helped client levels the playing field between state-owned businesses and private sector players, strengthen the policy environment (e.g., policy reforms in Kenya, Morocco, and the Philippines), accelerate industrial decarbonization (e.g., via ecoindustrial parks and support to innovation in Türkiye), and address key sectoral constraints (e.g., sustainable tourism development).\\n\\nTrade facilitation\\nIn fiscal 2024, our research explored the impact of government subsidies on trade and how the global cost-based trading systems can respond. Our trade facilitation and logistics experts advised clients on how to deploy digital solutions to speed the movement of goods across borders and through ports, thereby cutting trade costs and carbon emissions from existing volumes. Our quarterly Trade Watch series tracks disruptions to maritime shipping and our analysis on trade and climate is helping client countries meet their emissions-reduction targets while remaining integrated in global value chains.\\n\\n52 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024                              THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 53\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThere are two images on the pages. \\n\\n1.

Leveraging IDA and IBRD resources, the Food Systems 2030 Umbrella Trust Fund has committed $676 million in fiscal 2024, with cumulative commitments totaling $1.584 billion. In 56 countries, 128 grants are financing analytics and pilot investments that strengthen preparedness for food crises and pandemics, repurpose agricultural expenditures toward sustainability, and mainstream climate-smart agriculture practices, and digitize agriculture services. This includes $95 million in recipient-executed grants to reorient public expenditures toward more efficient and sustainable agriculture development in seven countries: Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we also published our Recipe for a Livable Planet report, the first comprehensive global roadmap to mitigate the agrifood systems’ climate impact, and established that $260 billion a year is needed for agribusinesses to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are providing safe drinking water to nearly one million people in the capital, Kinshasa, helping the Second National Ganga River Basin Project directly benefitted 3.7 million people—adding over 2,600 km of sewer network with over 317,000 house connections— and prevented 404 million liters per day of untreated wastewater flowing into the Ganga.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we published two new reports: Water for Shared Prosperity, with recommendations to improve water security and strengthen climate resilience; and Funding a Water-Secure Future: An Assessment of Global Public Spending, the first-ever attempt to create a comprehensive view of public financing and funding gaps in the global water sector. In collaboration with our partners, we introduced the Strategic Framework for Scaling Up Finance for Water to mobilize investments at critical times with climate goals, leveraging private sector expertise and capital for strategic, cross-sectoral action. Additionally, we partnered with the government of Singapore to launch the Singapore Water Center, a hub for innovation, knowledge exchange, capacity development, and a key pillar of the World Bank Group Academy.\\n\\nSocial inclusion and sustainability\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we expanded platforms to build partnerships for development that go beyond government and the private sector to bring in communities and civil society. We reviewed evidence and impacts of community-led approaches to identify strengths and next steps. We partnered with civil society on a Green Accountability initiative to enable more transparent, accountable, and effective investment of funds to combat climate change. And we strengthened the Bank’s support for building client capacity to manage social conflicts around development, including through a new offering in the World Bank Group Academy.\\n\\nINFRASTRUCTURE\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\n- We are working to improve energy systems, roads, and bridges.

The Europe and Central Asia Renewable Energy Scale-up Program will enhance renewable security and affordability over 10 years, providing 15 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity and reducing 240 million metric tons of carbon emissions in the region. The Accelerating Sustainable and Clean Energy Transition Program will put 20 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa on the path to universal energy access, providing sustainable and clean energy access to 100 million people by 2030. This work supports our ambition to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank. The expected private sector investment opportunities in distributed renewable energy alone will be worth roughly $9 billion.\\n\\nWe launched the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement Partnership to diversify mineral supply chains and help low- and middle-income countries capture a larger share of the growing demand for minerals. The Hydrogen for Development Partnership, founded and supported by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, facilitated $1 billion in concessional financing in fiscal 2024—the largest hydrogen engagement among all multilateral development banks—to ramp up clean hydrogen projects in India. We released the report The Critical Link: Empowering Utilities for the Energy Transition, with recommendations on how to assess utilities’ ability to deliver reliable, clean, and affordable power.\\n\\nOver the past three decades, we have provided more than $3 billion to help governments close coal mines and power plants while protecting workers and the environment. Our work on the just transition in coal regions is one of five priorities under the World Bank Group’s Climate Change Action Plan for 2021–25. We also work with governments and the private sector to reduce emissions and in December 2023, we launched the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Partnership, a $255 million fund to help developing countries cut carbon dioxide and methane emissions generated by the oil and gas industry.\\n\\n**Infrastructure finance**\\n\\nInfrastructure connects people with employment opportunities, promotes economic growth, and improves livelihoods. It also impacts our planet’s livability, as infrastructure both generates climate-changing emissions and is vulnerable to climate change effects. Transitioning to sustainable infrastructure demands trillions of dollars, but with government budgets often stretched thin, innovative financing and private sector investment are essential to bridging the financing gap.\\n\\nOur Private Participation in Infrastructure report noted that infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries totaled $96 billion in 2023, representing a 5 percent decrease from 2022, but on par with the previous five-year period. In response, we are leveraging the full suite of our financing instruments to remove the constraints blocking private sector investment. In fiscal 2024, we announced a major overhaul of our guarantee business with the goal of boosting annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030. This will help mitigate risk and catalyze private finance in development projects.\\n\\n**Sustainable and resilient transport**\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we lent more than $5 billion to 33 new projects addressing road safety, logistics, climate-resilient connectivity, and decarbonization. The Global Facility to Decarbonizing Transport welcomed Spain as a new member and received $3.8 million in funding, bringing the group’s total pledged funding to just over $13 million.\\n\\nSeveral of our projects launched in fiscal 2024 following years of collaborative development. In December 2023, Metro Line One opened to the public in Quito, Ecuador. Funded in part by the World Bank Group, the metro serves 400,000 passengers daily and is expected to reduce emissions from transport by an estimated 67,000 tons of CO₂ each year. In Dakar, Senegal, an electric-powered bus rapid transit system was launched to serve 320,000 commuters and should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.2 million tons over a 30-year period. Going forward, we will use the World Bank Gender Strategy, published in June 2024, to increase the number of women in transportation leadership roles to equalize the sector.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image depicts a modern cable-stayed bridge spanning a river, with a cityscape in the background.

The critical services that support development—like hospitals, schools, energy, and agriculture—rely on connectivity and data. In low-income countries, billions of people are still offline or lacking digital identification and skills. To close the digital divide, we collaborate with governments in more than 100 developing countries to build strong and trusted foundations and enablers for digital economies to thrive. The Digital lending portfolio comprised a record 53 active projects, representing $5.6 billion in total net commitments as of June 2024. More than a third of commitments (37 percent) were approved in fiscal 2024. Demand from middle-income countries also increased from 5 percent in fiscal 2021 to 24 percent in fiscal 2024, reflecting the recognition of the essential role digital technologies play in climate resilience, economic growth, job creation, and public service delivery.\\n\\nThought leadership and partnerships\\nOur inaugural Global Digital Summit, hosted in March 2024, brought together digital thought leaders, policymakers, and practitioners to explore the emerging opportunities and risks of digital transformation for development. We expanded access to data and knowledge through several publications, including the global flagship Digital Progress and Trends Report, 2023, which highlighted the accelerating pace of digitalization and the potential of artificial intelligence for development. The Green Digital Transformation report highlighted how to make digital transformation sustainable and leverage digital technologies for climate action.\\n\\nWe expanded our group of development partners through several trust funds—such as the Digital Development Partnership, the associated Cybersecurity Multi Donor Trust Fund, the Identification for Development and Government-to-Person Payments initiatives—to accelerate inclusive, safe, and sustainable digitalization.\\n\\nDigital Vice Presidency unit\\nTo maintain momentum for digital transformation across all sectors, we created a dedicated Digital Vice Presidency unit within the World Bank, effective fiscal 2025.

In this section, we detail our work in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nGENDER AND YOUTH\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\nIn fiscal 2024, 95 percent of Bank-financed operations used gender analysis to identify entry points to advance gender equality and measure the impact of specific actions, compared to 50 percent in fiscal 2017. We are investing in young people to help them transition into adulthood and productive employment and in fiscal 2024, we published the first global analysis of the online gig economy.\\n\\nGender\\nThe World Bank Group Gender Strategy 2024–2030 sets out three strategic objectives to achieve gender equality: expand gender-based violence and elevate human capital; expand and enable economic opportunities; and engage women as leaders. Informed by a two-year multistakeholder consultation process, three retrospectives and a series of policy notes, the strategy identifies innovation, financing, and collective action as drivers of change toward gender equality. Our work is focused on investing in women and girls while also addressing the disadvantages facing men and boys and the vulnerabilities arising from the intersection of gender with poverty, ethnicity, disability, and other characteristics.\\n\\nThrough IDA, we tackle challenges at the forefront of gender equality and girls’ and women’s empowerment, including around sexual and reproductive health, childcare, economic inclusion, entry of women into higher-skilled jobs, gender-based violence, and fiscal-policy and budget-system reforms. IDA resources have supported over 300 country-led actions in targeted areas and reached more than 700 million women and girls since fiscal 2015.\\n\\nOur Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE) supports innovative, scalable public and private sector solutions through new evidence and data, mainly in low-income countries and those affected by fragility, conflict and violence. UFGE has influenced over 300 World Bank projects, and shaped policy dialogue and reforms in 105 countries. It has also spurred gender-smart initiatives in over 80 private sector companies, including on women’s leadership and access to housing finance.\\n\\nOur Gender Data Portal makes gender statistics accessible through compelling narratives and interactive data visualizations. Building on resources and guidance produced under the Living Standards Measurement Study-Plus program and the Strengthening Gender Statistics project, it serves as a one-stop shop for global gender data, spotlighting more than 1,000 indicators for 217 economies.\\n\\nOur annual report, Women, Business, and the Law, measures the laws and regulations affecting women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies. The 2024 report found that women enjoy fewer than two-thirds the rights of men, far less than the previous estimate of three-quarters, due to the introduction of new indicators on women’s safety from violence and access to childcare services. No country provides equal opportunity for women, and closing gender gaps could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20 percent—essentially doubling the global growth rate over the next decade.\\n\\nLegal reforms that enhance women’s economic opportunities include prohibiting gender-based discrimination in financial services and products; lifting restrictions on the types of jobs and sectors imposed on women; mandating equity in pay; and establishing leave policies and protection from sexual harassment at the workplace. Our programs supported 14 gender-focused legal reforms in Jordan, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone in 2024.\\n\\nOur programs help women participate in economic activity, promote productive economic inclusion, and work to end gender-based violence. In Zambia, the Girls’ Education and Women’s Empowerment and Livelihoods project has supported about 140,000 women to enhance their livelihoods and close to 150,000 disadvantaged adolescent girls to enroll in secondary school. In Pakistan, the Punjab Resource Improvement and Digital Effectiveness Program supports women’s access to digitalized government services after natural disasters and during public health emergencies, including access to social protection, employment, and sexual- and gender-based-violence support services.\\n\\nThrough our support for the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative and investments by IFC and MIGA, we help unlock financing and support systems for women- and women-led businesses in developing countries. In Panama, IFC’s investment in housing finance for women is increasing the portfolio of mortgages for women, especially low- to middle-income households headed by women.\\n\\nYouth\\nOur work on youth focuses on investing in young people to ensure that they are ready to transition into adulthood and productive employment. Our extensive support for formal education aims to provide youth with the learning and skills they will need to succeed in a rapidly changing labor market. For youth outside of formal education, we support improvements in access to practical skills programs. In Bangladesh, we provided $300 million to equip about 900,000 disadvantaged rural youth—many of whom are female—with skills, alternative education, entrepreneurship support, and employment opportunities. In India, we have committed $195 million to training, upskilling, and providing more than 300,000 people with jobs in high-growth sectors including renewable energy, information and technology services, and hospitality.\\n\\nWe also support job creation and work opportunities for youth through loans and grants. For example, in Madagascar more than 300,000 jobs were created by strengthening the enabling environment for entrepreneurship and by enhancing private investments in productive infrastructure and improved services delivery. Through the $70 million South Sudan Women and Social and Economic Empowerment Project, we aim to help female entrepreneurs formalize and grow their businesses; as well as help survivors of gender-based violence access vital services.\\n\\nIn Kenya, a multifaceted approach—comprising training, internships, apprenticeships, start-up capital, and information provision—has benefited more than 300,000 youth. Our $150 million Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project boosted employment and earnings for youth who have experienced extended unemployment or engaged in vulnerable jobs. Participants received a mix of training, internships, apprenticeships, business start-up grants, coaching, and access to an online one-stop-youth information platform. More than 350,000 youth benefited directly from the project, and 30,000 benefited indirectly, while those previously employed saw a 20 percent increase in their income.\\n\\nAt the intersection of these efforts is the World Bank Group’s dedicated program on youth employment, Solutions for Youth Employment, which brings together donors, governments, foundations, private sector companies, civil society, and youth to support catalytic actions to increase the number of young people engaged in productive work.</td>\n",

The limited availability of these jobs, particularly for women and youth, is a pressing problem. In developing countries, only a third of employment is in the formal sector, and many people work in informal jobs that are low-paying and lack security. With support from the Jobs Umbrella Multidonor Trust Fund, the Bank Group leverages large-scale investment projects to improve job outcomes and support the transition to greener economies, offering dividends for both the environment and workers.\\n\\nIn Zambia, a multi-year project ending in fiscal 2024 boosted market linkages for 32,700 farmers and small and medium-size business owners. This led to respective increases of 27 percent and 73 percent in their sales and mobilized $4.8 billion in private capital. In Burundi, we invested $50 million in approximately 200 companies to increase private early-stage equity finance for innovative small and medium enterprises and create jobs. The project mobilized $58.3 million for early-stage seed capital and venture capital through project investment. A project in Lebanon created 647,000 labor days of short-term jobs for Lebanese and Syrians through investments in road infrastructure, spurring post-COVID economic recovery.\\n\\nThrough the Solutions for Youth Employment task force, the Bank Group supports youth employment and connects stakeholders with over 150 related operations. In September 2023, we published the report Working Without Borders, the first global analysis of the online gig economy.\\n\\n**PRIVATE CAPITAL MOBILIZATION**\\n\\n**AT-A-GLANCE**\\n\\nThe private sector is essential to closing the financing gap in developing countries. In fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group engaged the private sector through platforms such as the Private Sector Investment Lab, Guarantee Platform, and IDA Private Sector Window.\\n\\nEnabling private sector investment and capital flows are core activities and a priority of the World Bank Group. The three pillars of our approach—enabling private capital, building capital investment pipelines, and establishing private capital connectors—provide the blueprint to massively increasing the amount of private capital flowing into developing countries to advance development priorities.\\n\\nThrough the Private Sector Investment Lab, the World Bank Group is forging partnerships with private sector leaders to dismantle barriers impeding investment flows to emerging markets. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform aims to scale political risk insurance to over $20 billion annually by 2030. And the expansion of the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database is making credit risk data more transparent to unlock greater private capital flows.\\n\\nThe IDA Private Sector Window (PSW) leverages IDA’s resources and helps mobilize sustainable private sector investment in the poorest and most fragile markets. With the support of the IDA PSW, the first private equity fund targeted at small- and medium-sized enterprises was introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic, the first utility-scale renewable energy project is being implemented in Djibouti, the first global risk-sharing platform was created targeting Base of the Pyramid financing to reach the poor, and critically needed working capital is being provided to a group of Yemeni companies that produce and distribute basic food staples in the country.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe left image shows a motorbike rider with a phone mounted on their handlebar at a busy intersection during nighttime in an urban setting with bright lights and moving vehicles.

The World Bank Group's financing for countries affected by FCV stands at an all-time high.\\n\\nBy 2030, nearly 60 percent of the world's extreme poor will be in FCV-affected countries. An estimated 314 million extremely poor people live in 39 countries classified as fragile or conflict-affected. The World Bank Group’s FCV Strategy (2020-2025) guides our efforts to help them.\\n\\nThe Mid-Term Review of the FCV Strategy, published in fiscal 2024, concluded that we engaged in conflict situations—in Afghanistan, Haiti, the Sahel region, Somalia, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Yemen—to deliver basic services to people and protect institutions and development gains. For example, 72 million people in conflict situations benefited from the World Bank's job-focused interventions between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2022. We made significant progress in helping countries include refugees in their development priorities—expanding access to jobs, infrastructure, and services for refugees and their host communities.\\n\\nBank Group financing for countries affected by FCV stands at an all-time high. Average annual IDA financing for fragile and conflict-affected countries has increased nearly fivefold since IDA16, reaching 38 percent of total IDA resources, with more than half of the grants going to countries affected by FCV in fiscal 2024. The IDA20 replenishment will continue to allocate a significant share of resources to fragile and conflict-affected countries through June 2025. Crisis preparedness is a new cross-cutting issue under IDA20, as the poorest countries affected by FCV often experience complex crises. IFC and MIGA also leverage the IDA Private Sector Window to offer support and guarantees to help catalyze private sector investments in fragile economies.\\n\\nIDA support includes the FCV envelope (a top-up in addition to regular IDA allocations), as well as windows to support refugees and host communities, respond to crises (including food security), and promote regional approaches. About $8.8 billion has been set aside for the FCV envelope in IDA20 for eligible countries—an increase of 63 percent compared to IDA19 ($5.4 billion). In fiscal 2024, this includes $1.3 billion to help governments prevent conflicts from escalating. It also includes $252 million to help two countries transition out of fragility, and $179 million to remain engaged in high-intensity conflict settings in two countries. Another $2.4 billion has been set aside for the Window for Host Communities and Refugees in IDA20, with $1.2 billion approved in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nThe State and Peacebuilding Umbrella Trust Fund is the World Bank's leading global trust fund supporting implementation of the FCV Strategy. In 2023, the fund financed 42 grants in 30 countries with a total fund value of $51.3 million.\\n\\nMiddle-income countries host 58 percent of refugees, more than three-quarters of whom tend to stay for more than five years. The Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) supports middle-income countries that host large numbers of refugees. In 2023, $159.4 million in GCFF grant funding was allocated to Benefiting Countries, enabling $1.1 billion in multilateral development bank loans on concessional terms and unlocking a combined total of $1.3 billion. To date, 15.8 million individuals, including at least 6.3 million refugees and 7.2 million host community members, have benefited from GCFF-supported operations in Armenia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Jordan, Lebanon, and Moldova.\\n\\nWe engage with humanitarian, security, and peace partners because successful development in fragile countries requires peace and security. We partner with UN agencies and others to deliver on our development mandate in these countries. In exceptional circumstances, we rely on these partners to help provide basic services to people in conflict situations—with total financing of $9.6 billion to UN partners since 2015. In the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan, for example, we have teamed up with the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme to support social safety nets, including cash-transfer programs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND CAPITAL MARKETS\\n\\nPromoting sustainable finance and capital markets\\n\\nIBRD has mobilized finance for middle-income countries for more than 75 years, raising over $1 trillion from private investors since issuing its first bond in 1947. In fiscal 2024, IBRD, which is rated triple-A by the major credit rating agencies, raised $53 billion through Sustainable Development Bonds issued in a variety of structures and maturities. IBRD is the largest issuer of sustainable bonds and uses the funds raised from capital markets to support development activities in member countries. Please see the World Bank's annual Impact Report for more information about how funds raised in the capital markets support IBRD-financed projects. IDA also issues Sustainable Development Bonds to scale up its development impact and in fiscal 2024, issued approximately $12 billion in bonds.\\n\\nSustainable development through capital markets\\n\\nAs part of their efforts to mobilize capital from financial markets, IBRD and IDA continued to work with bond investors in fiscal 2024 to explain the mainstreaming of climate action and integration of climate and sustainability throughout our work. We also exchange perspectives with investors on development priorities such as biodiversity, education, nutrition, road safety, and water.\\n\\nEnabling sustainable finance markets\\n\\nThe World Bank Treasury's Sustainable Finance and ESG Advisory Services Program provides technical assistance to emerging markets to develop greener and more sustainable capital markets and financial systems, facilitate market-based financial solutions, and mobilize private sector capital toward environmental and social priorities. In fiscal 2024, we worked in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank to help Brazil issue its first sovereign sustainable bond. Proceeds from the €2 billion bond will fund deforestation control, biodiversity conservation, and programs to combat poverty and fight hunger. We provided technical assistance to the Government of Romania to facilitate its first sovereign green bond (EUR 2 billion), the largest ever euro-denominated green bond issued by an emerging market sovereignty. The proceeds will fund green transport projects, infrastructure for disaster resilience, and reforestation plans. With our technical assistance, Viet Nam's BIDV (Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam)—a state-owned financial institution and Viet Nam's oldest bank—became the first bank in Viet Nam to successfully issue a green bond in the domestic market.\\n\\nInnovating for a livable planet\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we developed the performance-linked impact-linked climate action and financial benefits. Uruguay, the first beneficiary of this product, could see a reduction of up to $12.5 million in interest payments over the life of a $350 million loan, as it achieves pre-determined reductions in methane emissions from beef production.\\n\\nWe helped over 20 countries manage financial risk for a total amount of $13.4 billion. For example, we helped the Philippines protect itself against interest-rate volatility by fixing the interest rate on almost its entire IBRD U.S. dollar portfolio. We also adjusted our pricing for IBRD loans in Japanese yen as of April 1, 2024, thereby enhancing the terms available to our clients.\\n\\nSecuring shareholder endorsement for new instruments\\n\\nWe received significant endorsement for our new financial instruments to boost lending capacity and enable us to take on more risk for shared global challenges with cross-border externality benefits. Our new World Bank Group Guarantee Platform, launched in July 2024, aims to boost our guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030 by bringing together expertise and products from across the Bank Group. Our Livable Planet Fund, launched in April 2024, offers governments, philanthropies, and other partners an opportunity to contribute to our concessional resources for middle-income countries.\\n\\nIn April 2024, a set of 11 countries announced commitments for the Portfolio Guarantee Platform, hybrid capital mechanism, and Livable Planet Fund totaling $11 billion. IBRD's unique leveraging capability enables the resources contributed through the Portfolio Guarantee Platform and hybrid capital to be multiplied up to six times over 10 years—potentially providing up to $70 billion in unregulated funds.\\n\\nManaging disaster risk through global capital markets\\n\\nAs a part of the expanded Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit, we enhanced our financial products to help countries withstand emergency financing needs. For example, we added Climate Resilient Debt Clauses to IBRD loans and IDA credits that allow eligible small-state borrowers to defer principal, interest payments, and other loan charges to help borrowers deal with the economic shocks of severe earthquakes and hurricanes that meet trigger thresholds. We also improved countries' access to pre-arranged (contingent) financing with new products and increased country limits. Finally, we reengineered our loan and credit mechanisms allowing countries to pay the costs of catastrophe bonds and insurance through Bank financing operations.\\n\\nThe Bank helps countries increase fiscal resilience against disasters by improving their access to the insurance and capital markets. Our Treasury works with governments to prepare or execute risk-transfer transactions before a catastrophic event occurs. In April 2024, we executed two catastrophe bond renewals totalling $745 million, including four Mexico catastrophe bonds providing $595 million in coverage against earthquake and hurricane disaster risks, and one Jamaica catastrophe bond providing $150 million in coverage against named storm risks. As of June 2024, we have helped countries transfer $6.5 billion of disaster risk into international markets. Of this amount, $1.4 billion addressing earthquake and hurricane risks in Chile, Jamaica, and Mexico are outstanding.\\n\\nBuilding capacity and managing assets for the public sector\\n\\nThe World Bank Treasury's Reserve Advisory and Management Partnership supports 76 public asset management institutions worldwide through advisory services, executive training, and asset management services—all through a global network of practitioners. The Bank also manages around $86 billion for trust funds and other official sector institutions. For the $45 billion trust fund portfolio, the Bank developed a sustainable fixed income investment strategy, focused on allocating development partners' capital to securities that are intended to make a verifiable, positive developmental impact.\\n\\nFor more information, visit treasury.worldbank.org.\\n\\nINNOVATIVE FUNDING SOLUTIONS\\n\\nIBRD has continued to structure bonds that provide financing solutions for specific projects, in addition to raising financing for IBRD's sustainable development activities through the broader bonds. For example, in January 2024, IBRD issued a $100 million principal-protected outcome bond, the Plastic Waste Reduction-Linked Bond, to support two plastic waste collection and recycling projects in Ghana and Indonesia. This new innovative bond provides investors with a financial return linked to Plastic Waste Collection Credits, Plastic Waste Recycling Credits, and Verified Carbon Units expected to be generated by the two projects. In addition to reducing plastic pollution and carbon emissions, the projects supported by the transaction help mitigate local pollution and air quality, reduce associated health impacts and costs, and create jobs in often overlooked and marginalized communities.</td>\n",

Our One World Bank Group Partnership Charter, published in May 2024, highlights the principles underpinning our work with partners and reinforces our vision of the partner we aspire to be.\\n\\nOur partnerships take many forms, from multistakeholder dialogues for exchanging insights and shaping initiatives to active strategic collaborations for jointly taking on development challenges. Collaboration maximizes our collective impact, mobilizes more resources more quickly, improves efficiencies, and limits aid fragmentation. In this section we detail our key partnership outcomes in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nMultilateral development banks\\nWe work closely with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to advance shared development priorities. In fiscal 2024, we launched a new Global Collaborative Co-Financing Platform with nine other MDBs to improve coordination among our institutions and with other co-financing partners. In doing so, we aim to fast-track solutions that can change the lives of people in developing countries. Participating MDBs include the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the New Development Bank.\\n\\nG7 and G20\\nWe engage closely with the Group of Twenty (G20) and Group of Seven (G7) to address global challenges. Under the Indian G20 Presidency in 2023, leaders pledged to collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank’s capacity to support low- and middle-income countries and committed to an ambitious IDA21 replenishment. The World Bank Group is leading on the implementation of recommendations from the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework Review and the Independent Experts Group report on strengthening multilateral development banks. Under the Brazilian G20 presidency in 2024, the World Bank Group is supporting the G20 Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty by scaling up social protection programs, generating hunger solutions and coordinating knowledge exchange, and providing country-by-country insights on hunger, poverty, and social protection coverage.\\n\\nUnder the Japanese (2023) and Italian (2024) G7 presidencies, the World Bank Group contributed knowledge and analytical work, as well as operational expertise and advocacy on climate mitigation and adaptation, health, trade, and financial sector issues. At the G7 Summit 2024, leaders welcomed the considerable progress that multilateral development banks had already achieved to be better, bigger, and more effective. G7 leaders committed to delivering innovative instruments such as hybrid capital and portfolio guarantees, which will make it possible to further boost Bank lending by around $70 billion over the next 10 years. G7 leaders also supported a successful IDA21 replenishment.\\n\\nAt the 2023 World Bank Group Annual Meetings, the World Bank and G7 partners launched the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement initiative to support critical investments and jobs in clean energy, particularly in Africa.\\n\\nThe European Union\\nThe Bank Group partners with the European Union (EU) and other development priorities across Africa and in the EU’s neighboring regions. In fiscal 2024, we responded to a closely coordinated one on our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including on Rapid Damage and Needs Assessments. Together with the UN, we agreed to deepen trilateral cooperation in fragile settings and to advance gender equality globally.\\n\\nInternational organizations\\nWe continued to work with UN agencies and other international organizations—including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Office for Project Services, the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization—to strengthen the resilience of countries while also supporting their long-term development. We defined the next phase of our collaboration with UNICEF and the World Food Programme in the fields of human development and food security; undertook a joint visit to Chad with UNHCR to support refugees and host communities; and, through The Pandemic Fund, allocated 19 grants in 37 countries to boost resilience to future pandemics.\\n\\nThe private sector\\nThe Bank Group plays a critical role in building partnerships and creating new opportunities for the private sector. Our Private Sector Investment Lab, launched in June 2023, is working to address financing priorities in private sector investment in emerging markets. The Lab’s 15 Chief Executive Officers and Chairs meet regularly to discuss ideas and most recently informed the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nOther stakeholders\\nThe World Bank works with civil society, foundations, think tanks, parliamentarians, and others to find development solutions that achieve efficiency, innovation, replicability, and scale. In fiscal 2024, we built partnerships across four of our six become better Bank, building support for this effort, and capturing their feedback. Many of these partners also advocate for IDA21 replenishment—acting as IDA champions, using their public and private voices to shape its direction and build support, and mobilizing their networks. Our engagement leverages the Annual and Spring Meetings, where we host more than 2,000 civil society representatives for the Civil Society Policy Forum, hundreds of parliamentarians and their staff, and key funders, companies, and thought leaders from around the world. We sought out other key moments, such as the UN General Assembly and COP28, as well as business and philanthropic convenings, to build coalitions around our advocacy and operations. New initiatives this fiscal year included a pilot country-focused forum in Mozambique that brought together local civil society representatives and online participants from Angola, Eswatini, South Sudan, and Tanzania.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, Connect4Climate, a Bank-housed multi-donor trust fund, launched Youth4Innovate to promote exchanges between youth and the private sector that spur green job creation. In addition, our work with more than 400 partners through the Partnership Fund for the Sustainable Development Goals continues to support initiatives that promote investments in environmental, social, and governance approaches and low-carbon development.\\n\\nWorld Bank staff support local and global charities through the Community Connections Campaign. In fiscal 2024, we raised over $13 million in donations, setting a record for global staff participation. We also helped staff respond to disasters throughout the year, raising over $560,000 in response to the earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/en/about/partners.\\n\\n72 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2023 73</td>\n",

The Bank Group's leadership are shaping the process with clear guardrails based on rigorous analyses and consideration, and further engagement on issues of strategic relevance. Through joint country representation, we are unifying country leadership for IBRD/IDA, IFC, and MIGA in 21 countries—giving clients a single point of entry to the entire Bank Group. We created a combined World Bank guarantee business to create a one-stop World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nOur Knowledge Bank initiative is refocusing the Bank not just as a funding mechanism, but also as a knowledge mechanism. The new structure with five themes (People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital) and three departments (focused on outcomes, innovation, and learning) is intended to dismantle barriers to the flow of knowledge both internally and externally. The Knowledge Compact for Action details this approach, with a focus on four areas: new and updated knowledge products, strategic partnerships, enhanced learning, and cutting-edge systems.\\n\\nOur new Scorecard for fiscal 2024–30 was approved by the Board in December 2023. Putting the Bank’s focus squarely on impact, this slimmed-down, focused Scorecard will allow shareholders and clients to clearly see the development outcomes the World Bank Group is supporting. And for the first time, all World Bank Group institutions—IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA—will use the same metrics.\\n\\nEnvironmental and Social Framework\\nOur Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) promotes sustainable and inclusive development outcomes in all our client countries. It strengthens protections for people and the environment by addressing a broad range of environmental and social issues in an integrated manner. It places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement and transparency. We apply it to all investment project financing (IPF) initiated on or after October 1, 2018.\\n\\nThe ESF seeks to strengthen clients’ environmental and social capacity and systems, promotes a risk-based and proportionate approach to environmental and social management, and allows for adaptive risk management responsive to changes in project circumstances. As of end-June 2024, the framework applies to 58 percent of our active IPF portfolio. In fiscal 2024, we introduced measures to further strengthen the implementation of the ESF.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/esf.\\n\\nProcurement Framework\\nIn fiscal 2024, 28,436 contracts worth $14.7 billion* were awarded across 1,468 Bank-financed operations. We continued to build on the foundation of our Procurement Framework by driving culture change and embedding procurement approaches that deliver value for money in the broadest sense, incorporating considerations such as equity, innovation, and sustainability. Effective September 1, 2023, we introduced the inclusion of ‘rated criteria’—non-price factors used to evaluate quality and sustainability—in most international procurement awards.\\n\\nWe developed a suite of Sustainable Procurement Guidance documents, offering practical advice to staff and borrowers to mitigate environmental and social risks in project procurement and promote sustainability benefits. We also issued a joint statement with the Heads of Procurement at other multilateral development banks to promote sustainable procurement initiatives. Additionally, we established Mutual Reliance Agreements to harmonize procurement systems with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/procurement.\\n\\nAddressing risks of sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment\\nThrough the Environmental and Social Framework, we strive to identify and mitigate the risks associated with gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (SEA/SH), in World Bank-financed operations.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, SEA/SH risk identification, mitigation and response approaches were integrated in our operations with pilots and human development. We launched a pilot initiative to address child sexual exploitation and abuse within transportation projects in Nepal and Bolivia. The insights and learning from these pilots will inform the development of additional resources and tools for similar operations in the future.\\n\\nTo promote SEA/SH awareness internally, we continued to run training sessions on the Environmental and Social Framework for sector specialists and trained nearly 500 staff in fiscal 2024. We have also integrated SEA/SH sessions into the broader training on the Environmental and Social Framework, benefiting more than 300 specialists.\\n\\nWe train clients on SEA/SH risk management through regional capacity-building initiatives, and we work with other international financial institutions to combat SEA/SH in development operations. We continue to promote the advancing of the SEA/SH agenda, cooperation and learning among Multilateral Financial Institutions by convening an SEA/SH working group. As part of it, we contributed to the UK Government’s Cross-Sector Progress Report on Safeguarding against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment 2022 to 2023.\\n\\nGRIEVANCE REDRESS SERVICE\\nEstablished in 2015, the Grievance Redress Service (GRS) provides individuals and communities with a robust channel to submit complaints directly to the World Bank if they believe a Bank-supported project has or is likely to have adverse effects on them, their community, or their environment. The GRS facilitates the response to such grievances by ensuring that the issues raised are promptly addressed through sound and sustainable solutions. In fiscal 2024, the GRS received 723 complaints from more than 100 countries, continuing a steady upward trend since its inception in 2015.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/grs.\\n\\nTrust funds and financial intermediary funds\\nTrust funds and financial intermediary funds (FIF), such as the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and the Global Infrastructure Facility, are key categories of private investment, a crucial component for addressing development challenges.\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal 2024, $57.5 billion was held in trust in the form of cash, investments, and promissory notes. Of this, $18 billion was for trust funds and $37.2 billion for FIFs. Trust funds finance about two-thirds of World Bank advisory services and analytics, and 86 percent ($37.1 billion) of total trust fund disbursements went to member countries during fiscal 2020–24. Of this amount, over $8.3 billion was disbursed to IDA and Blend countries (i.e., countries eligible for both IDA and IBRD lending). Contributions to FIFs averaged $10.4 billion annually, while cash transfers to implementing entities remained steady, with an average annual transfer of $8.1 billion over the past six years.\\n\\nIn recent years, as the architecture has evolved, trust funds have become more efficient and purpose-driven, reducing duplication and improving alignment with IDA and IBRD. The Bank’s trust fund portfolio now consists primarily of 72 umbrella programs, and many legacy funds are being wound down.\\n\\nUmbrella programs and FIFs are important arrangements for donors to support global challenges such as climate change, communicable diseases, and food and nutrition security. For example, the Climate Investment Fund, Global Environment Facility, and Green Climate Fund support the Bank’s work on climate mitigation, adaptation, and transfer of low-carbon technologies with significant potential for reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions in low- and middle-income countries.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/fif.\\n\\n*Please note this figure represents contracts awarded in fiscal 2024 based on the data as of August 15, 2024.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNo chart or table is present in the image.</td>\n",

Our Code of Ethics, which articulates what our core values mean in practice and focuses on behaviors rather than compliance, complements these values. The Staff Directives define the regulations and policies that guard against and prohibit misconduct. We build staff understanding of ethical and compliance issues in the workplace through mandatory e-learning, in-person sessions, townhalls, and other outreach on our core values and Code of Ethics.\\n\\nOur People\\n\\nOur diverse and global talent is our most important asset. At the end of fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group employed 18,300 full-time staff in 140 locations representing 184 nationalities. Women accounted for 54 percent of our workforce, reflecting our commitment to accelerate gender equality. We continually evaluate and improve our employee value proposition to remain competitive.\\n\\nDigital Transformation\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank Group designed an ambitious digital transformation to help us build a better Bank. We developed a framework to use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate, deepen, and sustain development impact and developed an in-house generative AI compatibility. To help staff securely use these technologies to increase their productivity. We also trained more than 75 million cyberattacks.\\n\\nEthics and Internal Justice Services\\n\\nThe Ethics and Internal Justice Services Vice Presidency unit (ELJ) promotes the Bank’s core values and provides comprehensive and coordinated services to address staff workplace issues and concerns. In fiscal 2024, the ELJ continued a new strategy that focuses on educating staff on available resources; speed in resolving their issues; building confidence that the internal justice system is fair and just; and combating the fear of retaliation from using ELJ’s services. By providing staff with advice, guidance, training, and conflict resolution, ELJ reinforces a speak-up culture and positive work environment.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, more than 2,800 staff turned to Ethics and Internal Justice Services for help. ELJ reviewed 191 allegations of misconduct: responded to 1,150 staff requests for ethics advice on potential conflicts of interest or other compliance issues; received 282 cases related to harassment, sexual harassment, or other inappropriate behaviors, and 29 cases related to racism or racial discrimination. ELJ has focused on the prevention of retaliation by strengthening the policies and processes to safeguard staff who report misconduct or engage in other protected activities. In addition, it reached 6,820 staff in fiscal 2024 through training and outreach.\\n\\nStaff Association\\n\\nThe World Bank Group’s Staff Association represents the rights and interests of all staff, no matter what their contract type, to senior management and the Board. In fiscal 2024, the Staff Association Executive Committee entered the first year of its two-year term, with focus areas including compensation and health insurance (particularly in country offices), employment visas, and flexible work.\\n\\nOur Places\\n\\nWe are making significant progress toward our goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to our facilities and food services. As of fiscal 2023, we are exceeding our target to cut GHG emissions from our global facilities by 28 percent by 2026, compared to 2016 levels. We are pushing to meet our emissions reduction target on food served at headquarters by 25 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.\\n\\nWe purchase Renewable Energy Credits equivalent to 100 percent of electricity used at headquarters and offset corporate GHG emissions based on rigorous Bank Group guidelines.

We also keep operations running smoothly by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities from approximately 26,000 vendors globally.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we surpassed our 2023 target to double our share of corporate procurement with spend from women-owned businesses to 7 percent, achieving 74 percent. We aim to reach 12 percent by 2030. Additionally, we intend to increase the number of women-owned businesses to 15 percent of our total vendors (from a 9 percent baseline in 2023). We continue to lead both private and governmental entities in this benchmark.\\n\\nWe have expanded our diverse-owned business initiative by focusing on countries with significant potential to support disadvantaged and underrepresented suppliers. We also advocate for other global organizations to join us in practicing inclusive procurement to empower diverse businesses.\\n\\n**CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED DISCLOSURES**\\n\\nAs part of this report, the World Bank is issuing its third climate-related financial disclosure (“disclosure”), reaffirming our commitment to transparency about the process around our identification, assessment, and management of climate risks, as well as its incorporation into our governance, strategy, and risk management process.\\n\\nThis disclosure is a step in our multi-year roadmap aimed at aligning our climate and sustainability-related financial disclosures with the standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board, while considering the unique business models of IBRD and IDA. This year’s disclosure highlights our efforts to date and demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our disclosures over the medium term. Please see the full disclosure in the appendices.\\n\\nTwo further reports, the Global Reporting Initiative Index and Sustainability Review, fully detail how we integrate sustainability into our operations and corporate practices. The two reports are available through the Annual Report website.\\n\\n**OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY**\\n\\nGuiding the Institution\\n\\nAll the powers of the World Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, the Bank’s senior decision-making body, according to the Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA. Each member country of the Bank is represented by one governor and one alternate.\\n\\nThe Board of Governors delegates most powers to 25 resident Executive Directors who comprise the Board of Directors for IBRD and IDA. The Executive Directors represent the World Bank’s 189 member countries and are responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank. The Executive Directors select a President, who serves as Chair of the Board. The current Board term is from November 2022 through October 2024.\\n\\nThe Executive Directors oversee the Bank’s strategic direction and represent member countries’ viewpoints on the Bank’s role. They are responsible for providing the Board of Governors with an audit of accounts, an administrative budget, and the Bank’s annual report on fiscal year results.\\n\\nThe Executive Directors’ Steering Committee, on which all Executive Directors serve, meets bimonthly to discuss the Board’s strategic work program. Each Executive Director also serves on one or more of five standing committees, which help the Board discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies and other key documents. In addition, an Ethics Committee provides guidance on matters covered by the Code of Conduct for Board Officials. Through its committees, the Board regularly engages on the effectiveness of Bank Group activities with management and with the independent Accountability Mechanism and the Independent Evaluation Group, both of which report directly to the Board.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nThe image shows a warehouse filled with stacks of boxes and inventory on shelves.

IEG's recommendations inform the Bank Group's directions, policies, programs, and operations. IEG is independent of the Management of the World Bank Group and reports directly to the Executive Board.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, IEG evaluated the Bank Group's progress against thematic priorities including financial inclusion, IDA’s support for job creation and local participation, and reducing gender inequality in countries experiencing fragility, conflict, and violence. IEG also validated management’s self-assessments of their implementation of IEG recommendations from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2022.\\n\\nIEG closely evaluated the Bank Group's private sector engagement on climate action and IDA’s Private Sector Window, a blended finance facility to support the Bank Group's focus on country-level outcomes. IEG completed Country Program Evaluations on the Kyrgyz Republic and Papua New Guinea. IEG also provided input to major strategy documents, including the Evolution Roadmap and the Knowledge Compact.\\n\\nFor more information and IEG’s annual report, visit ieg.worldbankgroup.org.\\n\\n**Accountability Mechanism**\\n\\nThe World Bank Accountability Mechanism (AM) is an independent body for those who feel harmed by Bank-financed projects. It includes the Inspection Panel (IPN) and the Dispute Resolution Service (DRS). The AM Secretary and the IPN each report to the Board and operate independent of Bank management. Affected communities can submit complaints to the IPN which, if authorized by the Board, conducts independent investigations. The DRS Secretary offers a voluntary dispute resolution process, handled by the DRS. If this is declined or unresolved, the matter reverts to the IPN for investigation.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the IPN received six Requests for Inspection and concluded the investigation of a case from Bolivia which, after Board discussions, led to a Board-approved Management Action Plan that responded to the IPN’s findings. The Board sanctioned an IPN recommendation to investigate a case from Viet Nam, which is now in dispute resolution, pursuant to an offer extended by the AM Secretary. The IPN was conducting an investigation in Tanzania toward the end of the fiscal year, while a decision whether to register two new Requests from Serbia and Pakistan was pending. The IPN did not register cases from India and Pakistan. Concurrently, the DRS facilitated a signed dispute resolution agreement in Cameroon, which is now in post-agreement follow-up and monitoring. The DRS continues to monitor agreements previously reached in Nepal and Uganda.\\n\\nFor more information on the Accountability Mechanism, visit accountability.worldbank.org/en/home and www.inspectionpanel.org.\\n\\n**Sanctions System**\\n\\nThe World Bank Group's Sanctions System addresses allegations of fraud, corruption, collusion, coercion, and obstruction—collectively known as sanctionable practices—in our operations. Based on Integrity Vice Presidency unit (INT) investigations, in fiscal 2024, the Bank Group sanctioned 37 firms and individuals through uncontested determinations of the Bank’s Chief Suspension and Debarment Officer, decisions of the Bank Group Sanctions Board, and settlement agreements. Fourteen entities met their conditions for release and one entity met the conditions for the conversion of its debarment, with conditional release, to conditional non-debarment. The Bank Group recognized 20 cross-debarments from other multilateral development banks, and 29 Bank Group enforcement actions were eligible for recognition by other multilateral development banks. INT investigated 66 cases of alleged fraud and corruption involving World Bank staff and corporate vendors, of which nine were substantiated.\\n\\nFor more information about the World Bank Group's Sanctions System and its annual report, visit www.worldbank.org/integrity. To report suspected fraud or corruption in World Bank Group-financed projects, or by Bank Group staff and corporate vendors, visit www.worldbank.org/fraudandcorruption.\\n\\n**Group Internal Audit**\\n\\nThe Group Internal Audit (GIA) Vice Presidency unit is an independent function reporting to the President and overseen by the Board's Audit Committee. Its assurance and advisory services help the Bank Group to more effectively serve clients.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, GIA’s priority engagements included enterprise risk management; grievances, complaints and whistleblower channels; implementation of the Bank Group’s Climate Change Action Plan; external website governance and security; and management of real estate. GIA continued to advance its Country Assurance and Advisory Program and began developing its Ukraine Oversight Program. GIA partners with bilateral, multilateral, and development organizations to strengthen oversight in challenging contexts, including in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence.\\n\\nFor more information and the Group Internal Audit’s annual and quarterly reports, visit www.worldbank.org/internalaudit.\\n\\n**THE WORLD BANK POLICY ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION**\\n\\nThe World Bank’s Access to Information Policy requires all our information to be accessible to the public, save for specific exceptions. The policy, in tandem with the Open Data Initiative, underpins our commitment to transparency.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank’s official repositories saw close to 56 million document downloads, and over 379,000 pages of archival records were declassified. The policy allows and encourages public inquiries into the Bank's operations, research, financials, and Board proceedings. During fiscal 2024, the Bank processed 598 requests for information, with 80 percent of these requests fulfilled within the 20-business-day standard.\\n\\nFor more information and to submit public access requests for information to the World Bank, visit www.worldbank.org/en/access-to-information.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSTRATEGIC RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank identified eight global challenges to prioritize in the next five years: Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, Fragility and Conflict, Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness, Energy Access, Food and Nutrition Security, Water Security and Access, Ending Digitalization, and Protecting Biodiversity and Nature. Addressing these will be key to advancing our new vision and mission.\\n\\nWe delivered 12 Systematic Country Diagnostics, which identify challenges to and opportunities for development in a member country; 13 Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF), which guide our support to a member country; and 12 Performance and Learning Reviews, which summarize progress made toward CPFs.\\n\\nIn April 2024, the Bank Group adopted a Framework for Financial Incentives to support projects addressing global challenges with positive cross-border impact. The framework gives shareholders the opportunity to make voluntary contributions to IBRD that are leveraged for maximum impact and used to address the most urgent global challenges of our time.\\n\\nFinancing instruments and approaches for countries IBRD and IDA offer a variety of financing instruments and approaches to help countries achieve their development goals. These include:\\n\\n• Investment Project Financing, which helps build physical and social infrastructure and develop institutional capacity;\\n   \\n• Development Policy Financing, which supports policy and institutional reforms, including through policy-based guarantees; and\\n\\n• Program-for-Results Financing, which links the disbursement of funds to the achievement of predefined results.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank approved various operations across these financing mechanisms, with a significant focus on climate co-benefits.\\n\\nWe approved 59 Development Policy Financing operations, totaling $22 billion; 43 Program-for-Results operations, of which there were additional financing, totaling $10.6 billion; and 251 Investment Project Financing operations, of which 65% were additional financing, totaling $36.1 billion. Climate co-benefits reached 45 percent of total commitments, including 30 percent for Development Policy Financing, 13 percent for Program-for-Results, and 58 percent for Investment Project Financing.\\n\\nOur Multiphase Programmatic Approach enables countries to structure long, large, or complex engagements into a set of smaller complementary Investment Project Financing and Program-for-Results operations under one program.\\n\\nThis approach facilitates both vertical programs, which involve in-depth, sustained engagement within a single country, and horizontal programs, which encompass multiple countries, states within a country, or subnational entities. In fiscal 2024, the Bank approved 10 vertical and seven horizontal Multiphase Programmatic Approach (MPA) programs, with up to $6.8 billion and $13.2 billion in program financing, respectively. The total amount of new Program financing approved, including Additional Financing, was $20.1 billion.\\n\\nIn February 2024, the Bank Group expanded the tools it offers countries for crisis response with the Board approval of a new Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit. This toolkit includes an expanded and innovative range of tools to help developing countries better respond to crises and prepare for future shocks.\\n\\nThe expanded toolkit includes a new Rapid Response Option to provide quick access to cash for emergency response by repurposing a portion of their unused Bank financing across their portfolio. This allows countries to swiftly address needs when a crisis occurs. The toolkit includes expanded access to catastrophe insurance and Climate Resilient Debt Clauses that allow eligible small-state borrowers to defer principal, interest, and fee payments for severe earthquakes and hurricanes.\\n\\nThe Bank is now rolling out these tools to countries—with new contingent financing operations approved and Rapid Response Options in place—with the ambition to have new crisis preparedness and response mechanisms in place for up to 50 countries by the end of the year.\\n\\nAdvisory services and analytics\\nIn March 2024, we published the Knowledge Compact for Action, which aims to transform ideas into tangible impact by employing data analytics, research, and best practices to offer clients innovative solutions to complex development challenges. We also reorganized the Bank’s practice groups into five Vice Presidencies units—People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital—to operationalize this goal.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank produced 982 advisory services and analytics products spanning more than 130 countries and addressing critical global topics such as climate change, economic growth and planning, public sector data development and capacity building, public administration, pandemic response, and jobs.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, 64 reimbursable advisory services agreements were signed for a total amount of $173 million in 21 countries. These services are requested and paid for by countries; client states, non-member states, including non-borrowing countries, can request them. Our services provided countries with technical assistance, capacity building, and implementation support on topics such as administrative transformation, social safety nets, energy transition, private sector-led growth, public investment management, and agriculture and judicial sector reform.\\n\\nSupport to small states Small states—countries with populations of no more than 1.5 million—are particularly susceptible to economic shocks, natural disasters, and the impacts of climate change. Disaster-related losses in these countries average roughly 5 percent of GDP a year due to capacity constraints, the small size of their economies, and, in many cases, their remote locations.\\n\\nIn 2023, several small states experienced double-digit inflation, leading to financial tightening and higher international borrowing costs. This has further exacerbated their debt vulnerabilities, with over 40 percent of small states already in debt distress or at high risk of reaching that point.\\n\\nTo help small states address their challenges, we are expanding IDA and IBRD resources. In fiscal 2024, this financing reached $11 billion, almost double last fiscal year.\\n\\nWe also are intensifying our management focus on small states as they grapple with economic shocks and climate change. The Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit and the Climate Resilient Debt Clauses will enable small states, UN Small Island Developing States, and Small States Forum countries to better prepare for and respond to shocks. In fiscal 2024, we published a Country Climate and Development Report for the Maldives. We started work on reports for Comoros and the Western Caribbean. The Small States Secretariat, housed within the Bank, hosts the annual high-level Small States Forum on the margins of the World Bank Group–IMF Annual Meeting. The October 2023 Forum focused on the World Bank’s efforts to assist small states in adapting to climate change.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/smallstatets.\\n\\nBudget management and reforms\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank delivered heightened support to countries facing a multitude of global challenges. This includes, in addition to financing, the advancement of knowledge and analytics at the country, regional, and global levels and bolsters the Bank’s staff presence in the countries we serve. We continuously improve our efficiency and redirect resources to frontline services by applying a rigorous budget discipline and implementing a savings program.\\n\\nAcross the Bank Group, we are boosting our effectiveness by streamlining business-planning and budgeting processes. For example, we cut the corporate budget-preparation process from nine to three months. In the current economic landscape, where financial resources are constrained, the Bank will prioritize efficiency gains and reallocation before expanding additional resources to strategic operational priorities.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/smallstates.\\n\\n82 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 83 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2023</td>\n",

As the largest multilateral development bank in the world, it provides loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and advisory services to middle-income and creditworthy low- income countries, and coordinates responses to regional and global challenges. In fiscal 2024, new IBRD lending commitments amounted to $37.6 billion for 126 operations, of which eight were IBRD and IDA blended operations.\\n\\nFor monitoring, reporting, and better decision-making about its commitments, the Bank applies a taxonomy of codes to all lending operations to reflect the sectors and themes to which it directs resources. Sector codes reflect high-level groupings of economic activities based on the types of goods and services produced and are used to indicate which part of the economy is supported by the Bank’s intervention. Theme codes reflect the goals and objectives of Bank-supported activities and are used to capture the Bank’s support to the Sustainable Development Goals.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 18: IBRD COMMITMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| REGION                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa          | 1,716 | 1,525 | 2,907 | 2,364 | 2,914 |\\n| Western and Central Africa           | 9     | 500   | 386   | 564   | 1,725 |\\n| East Asia and Pacific                | 4,770 | 6,753 | 5,482 | 6,636 | 6,788 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia              | 5,699 | 4,559 | 5,974 | 10,162| 9,302 |\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean      | 6,798 | 9,464 | 9,407 | 9,828 | 9,463 |\\n| Middle East and North Africa         | 3,419 | 3,976 | 4,135 | 4,697 | 4,233 |\\n| South Asia                           | 5,565 | 3,746 | 4,781 | 4,321 | 3,143 |\\n| Total                                | 27,976| 30,523| 33,072| 38,572| 37,568|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.\\n\\nTABLE 19: IBRD DISBURSEMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| REGION                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa          | 932   | 325   | 2,441 | 1,690 | 3,126 |\\n| Western and Central Africa           | 155   | 132   | 261   | 161   | 240   |\\n| East Asia and Pacific                | 4,679 | 4,439 | 5,439 | 4,350 | 5,492 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia              | 3,100 | 3,625 | 4,580 | 4,833 | 10,574|\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean      | 3,797 | 8,741 | 8,911 | 8,216 | 6,305 |\\n| Middle East and North Africa         | 2,416 | 2,764 | 3,407 | 2,946 | 3,332 |\\n| South Asia                           | 3,158 | 3,665 | 3,129 | 3,290 | 3,481 |\\n| Total                                | 20,238| 23,691| 28,168| 25,504| 33,560|\\n\\nTABLE 20: IBRD COMMITMENTS BY SECTOR, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| SECTOR                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry   | 1,767 | 1,260 | 3,611 | 3,669 | 2,194 |\\n| Education                            | 1,135 | 2,017 | 1,090 | 1,529 | 2,297 |\\n| Energy and Extractives               | 2,053 | 2,379 | 3,069 | 6,913 | 6,411 |\\n| Financial Sector                     | 3,702 | 3,828 | 1,877 | 2,412 | 3,182 |\\n| Health                               | 3,980 | 2,606 | 6,252 | 3,128 | 4,039 |\\n| Industry, Trade, and Services        | 2,208 | 3,030 | 1,916 | 2,301 | 2,330 |\\n| Information and Communications Tech  | 886   | 773   | 509   | 630   | 1,106 |\\n| Public Administration                | 4,301 | 5,666 | 6,848 | 9,314 | 7,679 |\\n| Social Protection                    | 4,786 | 4,800 | 3,466 | 3,270 | 4,426 |\\n| Transportation                       | 1,323 | 2,273 | 3,036 | 1,249 | 2,122 |\\n| Water, Sanitation, and Waste Mgmt    | 1,834 | 1,891 | 1,782 | 2,359 | 1,784 |\\n| Total                                | 27,976| 30,523| 33,072| 38,572| 37,568|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

IBRD is rated Aaa by Moody’s and AAA by Standard &amp; Poor’s, and investors view its bonds as high-quality securities. IBRD’s funding approach continues to be aimed at achieving the best long-term value on a sustainable basis for borrowing members. IBRD’s ability to intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets to developing member countries is important in helping achieve its goals.\\n\\nIBRD’s approach has enabled it to borrow at favorable market terms and pass the savings on to its borrowing members. Funds not immediately deployed for lending are held in IBRD’s investment portfolio to provide liquidity for its operations. In fiscal 2024, IBRD raised about $53 billion by issuing bonds in a variety of currencies.\\n\\nAs a cooperative institution, IBRD does not seek to maximize profit but to earn enough income to ensure the long-term financial capacity necessary to sustain its development activities. Of fiscal 2024 allocable net income, the Executive Directors approved the allocation of $834 million to the General Reserve and recommended to the Board of Governors the transfer of $515 million to IDA and $500 million to Surplus. From the Surplus (including $100 million currently in Surplus), $300 million is expected to be transferred to the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank and $200 million is expected to be transferred to the IBRD Surplus-Funded Livable Planet Fund, to provide a speedy and strong start to the new Framework for Financial Incentives. As part of its lending, borrowing, and investment activities, IBRD is exposed to market, counterparty, country credit, and operational risks.\\n\\nThe Bank Group’s Chief Risk Officer leads the risk oversight function and supports the institutional decision-making process via dedicated risk committees covering financial and operational risks. In addition, IBRD has put in place a strong risk management framework, which supports management in its oversight functions. The framework is designed to enable and support IBRD in achieving its goals in a financially sustainable manner. One summary measure of IBRD’s risk profile is the ratio of equity to loans, which is closely managed in line with its financial and risk outlook. As of June 30, 2024, this ratio was 21.5 percent, and the cumulative subscribed capital of IBRD totaled $223.1 billion, including $22.5 billion in paid-in capital.\\n\\n**For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/ibrd.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 23: IBRD KEY FINANCIAL INDICATORS, FISCAL 2020–24**\\nMillions of dollars, except ratios, which are in percentages\\n\\n|                  | FY20   | FY21   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| **Lending highlights** |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Net commitments a         | 27,976 | 30,523 | 33,072 | 38,572 | 37,568 |\\n| Gross disbursements       | 20,238 | 23,691 | 28,168 | 25,504 | 33,540 |\\n| Net disbursements b       | 10,622 | 13,590 | 14,876 | 12,736 | 20,115 |\\n| **Reported basis**       |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Income statements        |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Board of Governors–approved and other transfers c | (340)  | (411)  | (354)  | (221)  | (371)  |\\n| Net (loss) income        | (42)   | 2,039  | 3,990  | 1,144  | 2,412  |\\n| **Balance sheet**        |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Total assets             | 296,804| 317,301| 317,542| 332,614| 356,612|\\n| Net investment portfolio | 82,845 | 85,831 | 82,057 | 79,195 | 82,680 |\\n| Net loans outstanding    | 202,158| 218,799| 227,092| 241,041| 260,236|\\n| Borrowing portfolio* d   | 237,231| 253,656| 256,909| 266,828| 287,117|\\n| Total equity             | 40,387 | 48,078 | 55,320 | 60,826 | 63,484 |\\n| **Allocable income**     |        | 1,381  | 1,248  | 806    | 1,312  | 1,849  |\\n| Allocated as follows e   |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| General Reserve          | 950    | 874    | 589    | 921    | 834    |\\n| International Development Association      | —      | 274    | 117    | 291    | 515    |\\n| Surplus                  | 431 f  | 100    | 100    | 100    | 500    |\\n| Usable equity* f         | 47,138 | 49,997 | 50,481 | 53,105 | 54,655 |\\n| **Capital adequacy**     |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Equity-to-loans ratio (%)| 22.8   | 22.6   | 22.0   | 22.0   | 21.5   |\\n\\nNote: a.

It provides financing in the form of development credits, grants, guarantees, and loans to help these countries increase economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions for those most in need.\\n\\nFiscal 2024 marked the second year of the IDA20 cycle. In light of surge financing and additional volumes provided to IDA countries to address overlapping crises in fiscal 2023, as well as the compounding effect of a stronger U.S. dollar, IDA shareholders approved additional resources amounting to $7.8 billion to bridge the financing gap in IDA20. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors approved a moratorium on hardening of terms for all IDA countries in good standing with the Sustainable Development Finance policy to apply in fiscal 2024 and 2025, until IDA’s Grant Allocation Framework is reviewed during the IDA21 replenishment discussions.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, 75 countries were eligible for IDA assistance. New IDA lending commitments for fiscal 2024 amounted to $23.2 billion for 235 operations, of which eight were IBRD and IDA blended operations. These commitments included $23.1 billion in credits and $8.1 billion in grants. In addition, three projects for $550 million and three subprojects for $194.1 million were approved for support from the IDA20 IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window (PSW) during the fiscal year.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 24: IDA COMMITMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS**\\n\\n| REGION                      | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa | 9,581 | 14,089| 15,266| 14,368| 12,735|\\n| Western and Central Africa  | 9,054 | 10,955| 12,213| 11,390| 9,274 |\\n| East Asia and Pacific       | 2,500 | 2,115 | 1,673 | 877   | 1,328 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia     | 1,397 | 1,315 | 2,501 | 1,098 | 1,100 |\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 978   | 659   | 1,030 | 181   | 269   |\\n| Middle East and North Africa| 203   | 658   | 817   | 561   | 340   |\\n| South Asia                  | 6,092 | 7,127 | 4,217 | 579   | 6,239 |\\n\\n**Total**  \\n|                           | 30,365 | 36,028| 37,727| 24,254| 31,195|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

In 2016, IDA received its first‑ever public credit rating—triple‑A— which has been reaffirmed by rating agencies annually since then. IDA’s financial strength is based on its robust capital position and shareholder support, as well as prudent financial policies and practices, including a capital adequacy framework. IDA shares the same risk-management governance as IBRD. IDA uses this funding to support an ambitious policy package with special areas of focus and cross‑cutting issues for each replenishment cycle.\\n\\nFor IDA20, a global coalition of development partners agreed to a financing envelope of $93 billion (equivalent to SDR 65.1 billion)* to provide credits, grants, and guarantees to IDA’s client countries. Of this, $84.2 billion is expected to be used on concessional terms: $6.3 billion in IBRD terms for the Scale-Up Window, and $2.5 billion for the Private Sector Window. To help countries address the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, the Bank front‑loaded IDA19 resources to enable IDA to sustain the scale of financing at $35 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, excluding the Private Sector Window; the remaining amount of about $11 billion was carried over into IDA20. IDA has continued to lean forward on deploying resources in fiscal 2024 to help countries deal with multiple crises. As of December 31, 2023, $44.2 billion was committed on concessional terms, $3.6 billion on nonconcessional terms (through the Scale-Up Window), and $1.8 billion through the Private Sector Window. Administrative expenses for IDA are recovered primarily through net charges and interest paid by recipient countries.\\n\\nTo support IDA20, partners are providing $23.5 billion (equivalent to SDR 16.4 billion) in grants, $10.1 billion of which is the grant element from concessional partner loan contributions. Partners are also providing $0.2 billion in concessional partner loans, excluding the grant element, and $1.8 billion in compensation for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative during IDA20. As of June 30, 2024, 57 partners had submitted IDA20 Instruments of Commitment. Total Instruments of Commitment deposited to date amount to $23.5 billion, representing 99 percent of the total pledge amount. IDA’s borrowing program enables it to significantly scale up sovereign support for the Sustainable Development Goals while offering investors an efficient way to contribute to a global development. Under IDA20, the hybrid financial model—which blends donor contributions with market debt—enables IDA to mobilize nearly $4 in development authority for every $1 contributed by development partners.\\n\\nSince its inaugural bond in international capital markets on April 17, 2018, IDA has issued bonds in five currencies: euros, British pounds, Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, and U.S. dollars. In the first half of fiscal 2024, IDA issued approximately $6.2 billion in bonds. IDA continues to broaden its investor base and issued liquidity in various currencies from a diverse set of investors. We will continue to seek opportunities to further diversify IDA’s currency operation and develop its capital markets presence.\\n\\nIn July 2023, IDA’s Board of Governors adopted the decision to establish a Crisis Facility to scale up support for the countries most in need to address worsening development challenges due to the crises of multiple years, particularly food insecurity and extreme climate events. The Crisis Facility has two objectives: 1) to provide additional resources for countries affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a time of compounding, overlapping global crises; and 2) to provide a mechanism for scaling and leveraging contributions for specific countries, including rebuilding Moldova. This facility will support the deployment of partner contributions and will enhance IDA’s financing capacity in addition to IDA20.\\n\\n**TABLE 29: IDA KEY FINANCIAL INDICATORS, FISCAL 2020–24**\\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT RATIOS, WHICH ARE IN PERCENTAGES\\n\\n|  | FY20 | FY21 | FY22 | FY23 | FY24\\n---|---|---|---|---|---\\nLoans, grants, and guarantees\\nNet commitments* | 30,365 | 36,028 | 37,227 | 34,245 | 31,195\\nGross disbursements† | 21,479 | 22,921 | 21,214 | 22,718 | 28,247\\nNet disbursements‡ | 15,112 | 16,465 | 14,477 | 19,986 | 20,062\\n\\nBalance sheet\\nTotal assets | 199,472 | 219,234 | 220,014 | 227,824 | 241,350\\nNet investment portfolio | 35,571 | 37,921 | 39,561 | 30,762 | 33,581\\nNet loans outstanding | 160,961 | 177,779 | 174,490 | 187,669 | 198,457\\nBorrowing portfolio† | 19,983 | 28,335 | 35,032 | 35,393 | 47,028\\nTotal equity | 163,741 | 180,876 | 178,668 | 185,729 | 190,301\\n\\nIncome statement\\nInterest revenue, net of borrowing expenses | 1,843 | 1,996 | 1,901 | 2,367 | 2,398\\nTransfers from affiliated organizations and others | 252 | 544 | 274 | 117 | 291\\nDevelopment grants | (1,475) | (2,830) | (2,372) | (3,946) | (5,291)\\nNet income (loss) | (1,114) | (433) | 12 | (3,262) | (3,573)\\nAdjusted net income | 724 | 394 | 260 | 193 | 780\\n\\nCapital adequacy\\nDeployable strategic capital ratio\\nCurrent Approach† | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 34.8%\\nPrevious Approach‡ | 35.8% | 30.4% | 26.4% | 24.1% | 21.1%\\n\\nNote: For a complete presentation of fiscal year data, see the full financial statements: www.worldbank.org/financialstatements\\n* Commitments that have been approved by the Executive Directors (referred to as “the Board” in this report) and are net of full cancellations and terminations with respect to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

It is supported by $23.5 billion in contributions from 52 member countries, as well as contributions to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, financing raised in capital markets, carryover from IDA19, internal resources (such as loan repayments), and transfers from IBRD. IDA20 introduced new lending terms for eligible countries: shorter-maturity loans and 50‑year credits.\\n\\nIDA20’s policy framework maintains the four IDA19 special themes: climate change, fragility, conflict, and violence; gender and development; and jobs and economic transformation. It introduces human capital as the fifth special theme. IDA20 will also help deepen recovery efforts through its four cross-cutting issues: crisis preparedness, which was newly introduced for IDA20; debt; governance and institutions; and technology.\\n\\nThe IDA20 period began on July 1, 2022, and was reviewed at mid-term (MTR) in December 2023. The IDA20 MTR showed that IDA20 is fulfilling Policy Commitments (PCs) and is on track to meet or exceed the cycle targets for 83 of 84 PCs, with the remaining three advancing more slowly. IDA-supported operations continued to deliver positive outcomes for people in client countries. According to the Independent Evaluation Group ratings reported in the FY23 Update of the IDA Results Measurement System, the World Bank achieved satisfactory outcomes in 87 percent of IDA-financed operations. At the IDA20 MTR point, the number of IDA client countries that increased to 75 with Sri Lanka’s reverse‑graduation. At the MTR, IDA also launched the replenishment process for IDA21, the next round of financing to cover July 2025 to June 2028.\\n\\nFor more information, visit ida.worldbank.org.\\n\\n90 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 ©THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 91</td>\n",

      "20    **TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nWe also committed $35 million in grants to support emergency relief in Gaza. Working with the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the UN Children’s Fund, the grants support the delivery of emergency food, water, and medical supplies. In the West Bank, we approved a $13 million grant for the continuation of education for children, $22 million to support municipal services, and $45 million to strengthen healthcare and hospital services.\\n\\nEnabling green and inclusive growth\\nTo help policymakers in the region advance their climate change and development goals, we published Country Climate and Development Reports for the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, and Tunisia. In Libya, the catastrophic flooding in September 2023 devastated eastern localities, particularly the city of Derna. The World Bank, together with the UN and the European Union, produced a Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment to inform recovery and reconstruction efforts.\\n\\nWe signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Islamic Development Bank to promote further collaboration between our institutions. The MoU focuses on joint knowledge and operational engagements around the energy, food, and water nexus, climate impact, empowering women and youth to engage with the private sector, and advancing the digital transition and regional integration. The MoU aims to achieve a co-financing volume of $6 billion through 2026, 45 percent of which has already been met.\\n\\nExpanding economic opportunities for women\\nThe World Bank has drawn on a variety of instruments to support Jordan’s commitment to increase female labor force participation, including through the recently approved Country Partnership Framework. Through operations, technical assistance (such as Mashreq Gender Facility; Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative; and the Women, Business and the Law report), and policy dialogue, we have contributed to legal reforms in Jordan that removed job restrictions on women, prohibited gender-based discrimination in the workplace, and criminalized sexual harassment in the workplace. In fiscal 2024, we approved the first women-focused Bank project in the region: the Enhancing Women’s Economic Opportunities Program for Results aims to improve workplace conditions, increase financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, make public transport safer, and increase access to affordable, quality childcare services.\\n\\nAnalysing critical infrastructure needs\\nWe published an Interim Damage Assessment for Gaza in partnership with the UN and with financial support from the EU. This found that a preliminary estimate of the cost of damages to critical infrastructure from the conflict in Gaza between October 2023 and the end of January 2024 was around $18.5 billion—equivalent to 97 percent of the 2022 GDP of the West Bank and Gaza combined. When the situation allows, a full-fledged Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment will be conducted.\\n\\n**COUNTRY IMPACT**\\n\\nEgypt: The Bank-supported Takaful and Karama social protection program has reached 4.7 million vulnerable households, benefiting approximately 20 million individuals, 75 percent of them women.\\n\\nLebanon: A roads project has rehabilitated over 500 km of roads in 25 districts across the country and generated 1.3 million labor days for Lebanese workers and Syrian refugees.\\n\\nMorocco: Our programs have benefited more than 400,000 people directly, and more than 33 million people indirectly, through more than 230 disaster risk reduction projects.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nFigure 6 is a pie chart that illustrates the IBRD and IDA lending by sector for the Middle East and North Africa region in fiscal 2024.

    "In this section, we focus on transforming the textual content extracted from each page of the document into vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling efficient similarity searches and various NLP tasks. We also identify pages containing visual elements, such as images or tables, and flag them for special handling.\n",

    "  \n",
    "To address pages with visual information, we leverage a vision model to extract content from charts, tables, and images. Using specific instructions, we tag the extracted text and flag pages containing visual content. Although the vision model effectively captures much of the visual data, some nuances may be lost in translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a semantic search retrieves a page flagged for visual content, we use this tag to pass the original page as input to the model for Retrieval-Augmented Content Generation. A simple lambda function checks if `PageText` contains markers like `DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART` or `TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE`. If a marker is detected, the flag is set to 'Y'; otherwise, it's 'N'.\n",

IN FISCAL 2024, WE DID JUST THAT.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group adopted a bold new vision of a world free of poverty on a livable planet. To achieve this, the Bank Group is enacting reforms to become a better partner to governments, the private sector, and, ultimately, the people we serve. Rarely in our 80-year history has our work been more urgent: We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, mounting public debt, food insecurity, an unequal pandemic recovery, and the effects of geopolitical conflict.\\n\\nResponding to these intertwined challenges requires a faster, simpler, and more efficient World Bank Group. We are refocusing to confront these challenges not just through funding, but with knowledge. Our Knowledge Compact for Action, published in fiscal 2024, details how we will empower all Bank Group clients, public and private, by making our wealth of development knowledge more accessible. And we have reorganized the World Bank’s global practices into five Vice Presidency units—People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital—for more flexible and faster engagements with clients. Each of these units reached important milestones in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nWe are supporting countries in delivering quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030 so our children and grandchildren will lead healthier, better lives. This is part of our larger global effort to provide a basic standard of care through every stage of a person’s life—infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. To help people withstand food-affected shocks and crises, we are strengthening social protection services to support half a billion people by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women.\\n\\nWe are helping developing countries create jobs and employment, the surest enablers of prosperity. In the next 10 years, 1.2 billion young people across the Global South will become working-age adults. Yet, in the same period and the same countries, only 424 million jobs are expected to be created. The cost of hundreds of millions of young people with no hope for a decent job or future is unimaginable, and we are working urgently to create opportunity for all.\\n\\nIn response to climate change—arguably the greatest challenge of our generation—we’re channeling 45 percent of annual financing to climate action by 2025, deployed equally between mitigation and adaptation. Among other efforts, we intend to launch at least 15 country-led methane-reduction programs by fiscal 2026, and our Forest Carbon Partnership Facility has helped strengthen high-integrity carbon markets.\\n\\nAccess to electricity is a fundamental human right and foundational to any successful development effort. It will accelerate the industrialization of developing countries, strengthen public infrastructure, and prepare people for the jobs of tomorrow. But for the population of Africa—600 million people—lacks access to electricity. In response, we have committed to provide electricity to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank.\\n\\nRecognizing that digitalization is the transformational opportunity of our time, we are collaborating with governments in more than 100 developing countries to enable digital economies. Our digital lending portfolio totaled $56.6 billion in commitments as of June 2024; and our new Digital Vice Presidency unit will lead our efforts to establish the foundations of a digital economy. Key initiatives include building and enhancing digital and data infrastructure, ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy for institutions, businesses, and citizens, and advancing digital government services.\\n\\nDelivering on our commitments requires us to develop new and better ways of working. In fiscal 2024, we did just that. We are squeezing our balance sheet and finding new opportunities to take more risk and boost our lending. Our new crisis preparedness and response tools, Global Challenge Programs, and Livable Planet Fund demonstrate how we are modernizing our approach to better survive and meet outcomes. Our new Scorecard radically changes how we track results.\\n\\nBut we cannot achieve development on our own. We need partners from both the public and private sectors to join our efforts. That’s why we are working closely with other multilateral development banks to improve the lives of people in developing countries in tangible, measurable ways. Our deepening relationship with the private sector is evidenced by our Private Sector Investment Lab, which is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets. The Lab’s core group of 15 Chief Executive Officers and Chairs meets regularly, and already has informed our work—most notably with the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nThe impact and innovations we delivered this year will allow us to move forward with a raised ambition and a greater sense of urgency to improve people’s lives. I would like to recognize the remarkable efforts of our staff and Executive Directors, as well as the unwavering support of our clients and partners. Together, we head into fiscal 2025 with a great sense of optimism—and determination to create a better Bank for a better world.\\n\\nAJAY BANGA  \\nPresident of the World Bank Group and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image on the right shows a group of people interacting with each other outdoors.

These operational enhancements are both timely and necessary. While economic growth prospects for the near term have improved slightly, easing fears of a global recession, the post-pandemic recovery remains weak in many developing countries, and pre-existing social stresses endure. The world is increasingly unlikely to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, amid climate change, biodiversity loss, and escalating geopolitical tensions further threatening development. To help countries address their intertwined challenges, the World Bank Group committed $117.5 billion (including $37.6 billion from IBRD, $34.7 billion from IFC, $2.8 billion from MIGA, and $38.9 billion in recipient-executed disbursing activities) in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nThe 2023 Annual Meetings marked an important milestone for the World Bank Group as Development Committee members endorsed the institution’s new vision of a world free of poverty on a livable planet. Since then, the Bank Group has implemented core reforms to build a better Bank, including enhancing its financial capacity; reinforcing its effectiveness and results; and improving operational and financial efficiency. The Bank Group has also developed a new Secured and crisis preparedness and response tools; launched the Global Challenge Programs and World Bank Group Guarantee Platform; developed a Knowledge Compact; forged four new partnerships (with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank); and streamlined the implementation of the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework.\\n\\nExecutive Directors commend the Bank Group’s commitment to devote 45 percent of annual financing to climate action by 2025, deployed equally between mitigation and adaptation. IFC and MIGA will intensify efforts to boost private sector financing for climate adaptation. Executive Directors also applaud the Bank Group’s 2030 commitments to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Africa in partnership with the African Development Bank and to provide quality, affordable healthcare to 1.5 billion people.\\n\\nThe Bank Group is enhancing its financing model to increase support for developing countries in low-income countries. Since the 2023 Annual Meetings, the Bank Group has raised funds for the IDA (crisis fund) and maintained IDA’s financial capacity of $30 billion per year for fiscal 2024 and 2025. Bank Group management has proposed commitments to IDA’s Capital Adequacy Framework that are expected to expand IDA’s financing by $20 billion through fiscal 2037. Executive Directors anticipate the funding generated by these measures, coupled with strong donor contributions for the December 2024 IDA replenishment, will improve lives and equip nations to tackle immediate crises and long-term development goals. Beyond financing, achieving these goals requires the unwavering commitment of current and new donors, client countries, and the World Bank.\\n\\nIBRD has made significant progress in enhancing its financial capacity while continuing to protect its triple-A rating and long-term financial stability. New financial instruments—such as hybrid capital, a portfolio guarantee platform, and the Livable Planet Fund—have been approved, and contributions have already been pledged by some Bank Group shareholders. The Board recently approved the Framework for Financial Intermediaries, which will encourage IBRD countries to boost investments in global challenges such as cross-border impact. Progress has been made toward enhancing the value of callable capital. In addition, IFC and MIGA are expanding their investment and guarantee offerings, including new instruments to mobilize private capital. Executive Directors look forward to the further operationalization of the Crisis Loss and Damage Fund, which is expected to be a significant resource in assisting developing nations affected by natural disasters linked to climate change.\\n\\nExecutive Directors welcome the Bank Group’s deepening partnerships with multilateral development banks and the private sector. The One World Bank Group Partnership Charter, published in May 2024, highlights the principles that define our work with partners and restates our vision of the partner we aspire to be. The Private Sector Investment Lab, launched in June 2023, is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets.\\n\\nThrough travel to several client countries this year, Executive Directors witnessed the Bank Group’s impact firsthand. During visits to Saudi Arabia (December 2023); China, Fiji, and Suriname (January-February 2024); Kazakhstan; Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan (March 2024); and Kenya and Ecuador (May 2024), Board members engaged with key government officials, private sector representatives, Bank Group staff, beneficiaries of Bank Group operations, donors, and other pertinent stakeholders.\\n\\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, the Executive Directors and management remain committed to sharpening the Bank Group’s approach to better serve people in low-income countries. The Executive Directors extend heartfelt tribute to Ajay Banga for his leadership in spearheading the evolution of the Bank Group, and sincerely thank all staff across the institution for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to the mission of ending poverty on a livable planet.\\n\\nFront row (left to right): Parameswaran Iyer, India; Abdullah Al Mulla, Kuwait; Ernesto Acevedo, Mexico; Felipe Gordoa, United States (Alternate Executive Director); Will Greenman, United Kingdom; Matteo Bugamelli, Italy (Dean); Junbong Chang, China (Co-Dean); Dominique Favre, Switzerland; Agondo Didiza, South Africa; Abdul Salam Bello, Niger; Arnaud Buisse, France\\n\\nBack row (left to right): Daniel Parlier, Argentine; Lene Lind, Norway; Katherine Reiche, Canada; Suhail Sedi, Saudi Arabia; Michael Krake, Germany; Marcos Chlestos, Brazil; Hideaki Imamura, Japan; Herbert Ngobiura, Burundi; T.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nBECOMING A BETTER BANK\\n\\nThe world is confronting a set of intertwined challenges—poverty, the climate crisis, debt, food insecurity, pandemics, and fragility—and a need to accelerate access to clean air, energy, and water. Time is of the essence.\\n\\nWe need a better Bank to address these challenges and the challenges of tomorrow.\\n\\nThe G20 Leaders requested the World Bank Group to change and be a more significant part of the solution. In response, we raised our ambition for speed, simplicity, better leveraging our balance sheet, and engaging partners and the private sector. Here's how we are enhancing our approach:\\n\\nFINANCIAL INNOVATIONS\\nOur new financial instruments are designed to boost lending capacity and enable the World Bank Group to take on more risk for shared global challenges. We've squeezed $40 billion over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan-to-equity ratio. We've launched a hybrid-capital instrument. Our Livable Planet Fund, launched in April 2024, offers governments, philanthropies, and other partners an opportunity to contribute to our concessional resources for middle-income countries.\\n\\nPRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT LAB\\nThe Private Sector Investment Lab is a collaborative initiative between the World Bank Group and directors of leading global private sector institutions. Its goal is to develop solutions that address existing barriers to private sector investment in emerging markets and developing economies. The Lab's core group of 15 CEOs and Chairs have delivered recommendations on regulatory certainty, increased use of guarantees, foreign-exchange-risk mitigation, and increased use of originate-to-distribute models for mobilization of private capital. Their feedback has already informed the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nWORLD BANK GROUP GUARANTEE PLATFORM\\nThis new platform is delivering simplicity and improved access to our guarantee products, putting us on a path to boost our annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030—and multiply our mobilization of private capital many times.\\n\\nGLOBAL EMERGING MARKETS RISK DATABASE (GEMS) CONSORTIUM\\nThe GEMs Consortium comprises 25 multilateral development banks and development finance institutions. The World Bank Group and the GEMs Consortium are driving transparency and mobilizing private investment in emerging markets by releasing comprehensive credit risk data.\\n\\nWORLD BANK GROUP SCORECARD\\nAccountability and focus underpin all our work. Our new Scorecard is a yardstick of accountability and a cornerstone of our efforts for greater efficiency, impact, and results. This tool allows our shareholders and taxpayers to clearly see the impact we are making, rewarding their trust.\\n\\nCRISIS PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE TOOLKIT\\nThe World Bank Group is rolling out an expanded Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit to help developing countries better respond to crises and build resilience against future shocks. Climate Resilient Debt Clauses will allow small states to prioritize disaster recovery over debt repayment when catastrophes hit.\\n\\nKNOWLEDGE BANK\\nKnowledge has been critical to the World Bank Group for 80 years, and we are refocusing ourselves not just as a funding mechanism, but also as a source of knowledge. To do this, we are bringing experts to the forefront of our country-driven model, working with governments to craft focused development plans that marry their ambition and our expertise. The Knowledge Compact for Action details this approach, and we focus on four areas: new and updated knowledge products, strategic partnerships, enhanced learning, and cutting-edge systems.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe page contains several images depicting various activities and initiatives related to banking and finance. These include photos of people in different professional settings, infrastructure, and digital interfaces, representing themes discussed in the text such as financial innovations, private sector investment, and knowledge sharing.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $15.6 billion for 96 operations in the region, including $2.9 billion in IBRD commitments and $12.7 billion in IDA commitments. We also leveraged data and analytics to help countries in the region reach their development potential.\\n\\nImproving education and health services\\nIn fiscal 2024, we approved the East Africa Girls’ Empowerment and Resilience Program to support more than 2 million girls to stay in or return to school and enable 160,000 women to increase their productivity in the labor market in Mozambique and Madagascar. The program is expected to reach more than 6 million people—including traditional leaders, parents, and other boys—through behavioral change and will enhance the capacity of 26,000 local administrators, community leaders, and service providers to implement gender equality reforms.\\n\\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are increasing access to education, particularly for girls, and improving teaching-learning conditions at secondary schools in selected provinces. This includes creating safe and inclusive school environments, strengthening curriculum and educational materials, as well as equipping girls and boys with digital skills. In Tanzania, our results-based financing education program led to 1.6 million students enrolling in preprimary and primary schools.\\n\\nTo improve school attendance in Ethiopia, we are equipping more than 5,000 schools with essential water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities and\\n\\nExpanding access to electricity across Rwanda\\nThe World Bank Group and the African Development Bank have committed to provide electricity to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. Together, we aim to help countries across Sub-Saharan Africa expand energy access while addressing climate change.\\n\\nRwanda, which has expanded electricity access from 6 percent in 2009 to more than 75 percent as of March 2024, is leading the way. One hundred percent of its health centers and administrative facilities and 84 percent of its schools now have electricity.\\n\\nThe Government of Rwanda laid the foundation for this remarkable progress in 2008, when it engrained electrification targets in its national strategies and set up the Electricity Access Rollout Program to implement these targets.\\n\\nThe World Bank accelerated progress by initiating $475 million in Development-Policy Operations loans, with Rwanda implementing comprehensive energy sector policies that resulted in improvements to the legal and fiscal responsivity, including tariff reforms, geo-spatial planning, increased electrification, and strategies to promote off-grid electrification. As a result, Rwanda’s demand-induced electricity sector subsidies are below 1.4 percent of GDP while aggressively expanding electrification.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 2: EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022-24\\n\\n|       | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\\n|       | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n| IBRD  | 2,907  | 2,364  | 2,914  | 2,441  | 1,690  | 3,126  |\\n| IDA   | 15,266 | 14,368 | 12,735 | 7,133  | 10,417 | 10,696 |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $78.8 billion.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows several people standing on a pavement, appearing to be using mobile phones or interacting with each other.

In Malawi, we are improving WASH infrastructure in schools to benefit more than 25,000 students through the Lilongwe Water and Sanitation Project. The project has also provided water supply upgrades for more than 370,000 people as of March 2024.\\n\\nEnabling the energy transition  \\nOur Accelerating Sustainable and Clean Energy Access Transformation Program aims to increase access to sustainable and clean energy across the region by 2030. The program will benefit 100 million people by expanding access to grid and off-grid electricity in a region where only 46 percent of the overall population—and just 26 percent in rural areas—has access to electricity. We also published our Country Climate and Development Reports with recommendations to accelerate the energy transition for Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.\\n\\nTo protect nearly 2 million people from water-related climate shocks, including flooding, we approved the second phase of the Regional Climate Resilience Program for Eastern and Southern Africa, which aims to strengthen infrastructure, disaster-risk management, and social protection systems in Malawi and the region.\\n\\nExpanding market size  \\nLeveraging regional initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), we help fast-track domestic reforms to attract and retain sustainable investment. Our project in Rwanda, the first in a series, supported alignment of the country’s legislation with the AfCFTA Investment Protocol and has marked its existing dispute-prevention mechanism reforms on green issues to be fast-tracked. In Zambia, we supported the development of a model international investment agreement aligned with the Protocol.\\n\\nStrengthening critical soft infrastructure  \\nIn partnership with the African Development Bank, the IMF, and the UN, we strengthened the staffing and institutional capacity of Somalia’s government ministries and central agencies, enabling the country to save $4.5 billion in debt servicing and reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative Completion Point in December 2023.\\n\\nClosing the digital divide  \\nThrough the Eastern Africa Regional Digital Integration Project series, we are increasing affordable access to regional broadband connectivity, strengthening the enabling environment and policy convergence for cross-\\nborder digital trade and data flows, and promoting digital skills development.\\n\\n**COUNTRY IMPACT**\\n\\nMalawi: We have enabled 4.3 million people to access affordable, high-quality internet services.\\n\\nTanzania: As a partner to Tanzania’s judiciary, we financed the construction of 18 subordinate courts, extending judiciary services to more than 1.3 million citizens.\\n\\nUganda: After bringing electricity to 8.8 million people, we are expanding access to a further 5.7 million people, including 500,000 refugees.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\n**FIGURE 1: EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA**  \\nIBRD AND IDA LENDING BY SECTOR - FISCAL 2024  \\nSHARE OF TOTAL OF $15.6 BILLION\\n\\nA pie chart shows the distribution of lending by sector in Eastern and Southern Africa.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\n**WESTERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA**\\n\\n*AT-A-GLANCE*\\nAcross Western and Central Africa, we aim to empower women, boost food security and climate resilience, and strengthen social infrastructure and digitalization. In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $11 billion for 66 operations in the region, comprising $1.7 billion in IBRD commitments and $9.3 billion in IDA commitments. About half of these commitments went to countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence.\\n\\n*Empowering women through education and health services*\\nOur projects have enabled an additional 1.8 million girls to enroll in secondary education across the region, laying the foundation for future economic growth. To build on these results, we approved additional financing of $700 million to scale the Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment in Nigeria. We aim to reach 8.6 million girls through the program and more than 250,000 eligible girls have received scholarships to date. In Senegal, the $75 million Investing in Early Years for Human Development Project has benefited 14 million mothers and children through a range of early childhood interventions and essential nutrition services. It also increased birth registrations from 43 percent in 2018 to 73 percent in 2023.\\n\\n*Boosting food security and climate resilience*\\nWe provided emergency food assistance for 3.4 million people and agricultural support to 11 million farmers in the region. Through the West Africa Food System Resilience Program, more than 1.6 million farmers are receiving climate-smart agricultural training, helping them increase yields and reduce losses. We established national food reserves in 12 countries and supported 5 regional centers of excellence to strengthen the food security value chain.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE:**\\n\\nThe image shows a woman standing in front of a window with colorful curtains.

The park will supply electricity to 250,000 people in the capital of Bangui, almost doubling the country’s electricity generation capacity. It will replace over 90 percent of the energy currently produced by diesel fuel, while generating more than $4 million per year for the National Electricity Company. It will also contribute to a net reduction of emissions of around 670,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂).\\n\\nIn Nigeria, more than 17.5 million Nigerians, or 20 percent of the currently unserved population, will benefit from our Nigeria Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-Up Project, which will replace more than 280,000 polluting and expensive fossil-fueled generator sets with standalone solar. In addition, we are completing the 225-kilovolt transmission line of the Gambia River Basin Development Organization to connect The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal through 15 substations, such as the Tambacounda power station.\\n\\nThese projects, and many more like them, laid the foundation for the Bank Group’s commitment to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank.</td>\n",

More than 63,800 metric tons of fertilizers have been distributed to over 530,000 farmers in those countries. Emergency support was extended to Ghana in fiscal 2024 to provide more than 128,000 farmers with 29,000 metric tons of fertilizer, weedicides, and seeds. At the 2023 Annual Meetings, the World Bank and the Crop Group announced a partnership to support 5 million farmers in Benin, Guinea, Mali, and Togo, covering 10 million hectares.\\n\\nImproving the business environment\\nIn Nigeria, we are supporting efforts to enhance the business-enabling environment. Through our Ghana Economic Transformation Project, we are promoting regulatory transparency through technology-enabled services and boosting citizen engagement through e-portals.\\n\\nStrengthening social-protection infrastructure and digital-service delivery\\nWe have expanded safety nets for more than 50 million people, catalyzing investments in social registries and digital delivery systems.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $8 billion for 37 operations in the region, including $6.8 billion in IBRD commitments and $1.2 billion in IDA commitments.\\n\\nWe remain engaged in Myanmar, aligned with the World Bank Group Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (2020–2025). We continue to deepen our partnerships with non-borrowing member countries, including Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, allowing us to exchange development lessons and solutions for shared priorities.\\n\\n**Table 6: East Asia and Pacific**\\nRegional Commitments and Disbursements—Fiscal 2022–24\\n\\n**Piloting sustainable farming methods to reduce methane and boost prosperity in Viet Nam**\\nThe Viet Nam Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project (VnSAT) has successfully piloted new rice farming techniques to lower emissions, increase farmers’ net incomes, and can be scaled and replicated in other countries.\\n\\nRice, a staple crop for more than half the world’s population, produces high levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). But using VnSAT techniques, GHG emissions from about 180,000 hectares of rice land were reduced by approximately 1.5 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year compared with traditional farming. The project enabled 150,000 rice farmers to improve their average profit per hectare by about 30 percent, compared with households outside the project.\\n\\nThe success of the VnSAT program provides lessons for other agricultural sectors, including coffee, livestock, and fisheries, and its techniques are ready to be applied in other rice-growing areas. In China, which contributes about 30 percent of the world’s rice production, the Methane-Reducing and Water-Saving Paddy Rice Program aims to reduce methane emissions, improve irrigation and drainage services, and provide agricultural support for climate-resilient rice production in Hunan province, China’s largest rice production area.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 6: EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC**\\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022-24\\n\\n|          | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\\n|          | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n| IBRD     | 5,482  | 6,636  | 6,788  | 5,439  | 4,350  | 5,492  |\\n| IDA      | 1,673  | 877    | 1,238  | 1,502  | 1,448  | 1,015  |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $32.7 billion.</td>\n",

We approved the Europe and Central Asia Renewable Energy Scale-up Program with the aim of adding 15 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, reducing 240 million metric tons of carbon emissions, and creating more than 90,000 renewable energy jobs. Türkiye, the first country to borrow through this program, is expanding its municipal solar energy market for businesses and households and piloting distributed battery storage technology.\\n\\nAcross Central Asia, we are benefiting 50,000 people by restoring transboundary landscapes through the Resilient Landscape Restoration Project. In the Kyrgyz Republic, we are promoting sustainable development by improving water access for 200,000 people in 94 villages and helping to restore rural landscapes. We also published Country Climate and Development Reports for Azerbaijan, Romania, and Uzbekistan. The recommendations in these reports have informed sustainable development policy dialogues and operations.\\n\\nEnhancing economic prosperity and job creation  \\nWe support reforms and investments focused on private sector-led growth and job creation. Our development policy loans and other operations create markets by improving competition regulation, enhancing the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, and removing disputes in finance. In Kosovo, our Effectiveness, Competitiveness, and Green Growth Development Policy Financing is enabling job creation and a cleaner environment. In Kazakhstan, we are extending the research and development ecosystem to drive innovation and create jobs through the Fostering Productive Innovation Project.\\n\\nCOUNTRY IMPACT\\n\\nTajikistan: Nearly 3 million people have directly benefited from our resilience-building projects spanning agribusiness, childhood immunizations, and disaster risk management.\\n\\nTürkiye: Our low-carbon development strategies could reduce carbon emissions by 70 percent, yielding $146 billion in economic opportunity (or 1 percent of GDP) by 2040.\\n\\nUkraine: We have helped more than 13 million people receive timely payments of pensions and social assistance, alongside the continued provision of critical health, education, and other essential services.\\n\\nImproving physical and digital connectivity  \\nOur research shows that with the right investment and policies, a transport route across the Middle Trade and Transport Corridor countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus could triple trade volumes while halving travel time by 2030. To expand digital infrastructure, we allocated additional financing for the Digital Central Asia South Asia Project which provides internet access for more than 800,000 people in the Kyrgyz Republic. The project is increasing internet penetration to 57 percent of the country, attracting private investment and improving digital government services.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/eca.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\n**FIGURE 4: EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA IBRD AND IDA LENDING BY SECTOR - FISCAL 2024 SHARE OF TOTAL OF $10.4 BILLION**\\n\\nA pie chart dividing sectors for lending:  \\n- Energy and Extractives: 19%  \\n- Financial Sector: 14%  \\n- Public Administration: 18%  \\n- Social Protection: 25%  \\n- Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management: 11%  \\n- Transportation: 2%  \\n- Education: 1%  \\n- Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry: 5%  \\n- Health: 4%  \\n- Information and Communications Technologies: 3%  \\n- Industry, Trade, and Services: 9%  \\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 9: EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA REGIONAL SNAPSHOT**\\n\\n| INDICATOR                                         | 2000  | 2012  | CURRENT DATAa |\\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------------|\\n| Total population (millions)                       | 216.0 | 232.7 | 247.5         |\\n| Population growth (annual %)                      | 0.4   | 0.8   | 0.2           |\\n| GNI per capita (Atlas method, current US$)        | 1,874.3 | 6,825.7 | 7,691.9      |\\n| GDP per capita growth (annual %)                  | 6.4   | 3.2   | 4.4           |\\n| Population living below $2.15 a day (millions)    | 43.3  | 4.2   | 2.3           |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, females (years)         | 73.0  | 76.2  | 77.6          |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, males (years)           | 65.0  | 69.0  | 70.7          |\\n| Carbon dioxide emissions (megatons)               | 2,577.2 | 2,595.7 | 2,830.7      |\\n| Extreme poverty (% of population below $2.15 a day, 2007 PPP) | 9.2   | 0.9   | 0.5           |\\n| Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods, services, and primary income | 18.9  | 14.9  | 17.8          |\\n| Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%) (modeled ILO estimate) | 68.2  | 67.2  | 64.7          |\\n| Vulnerable employment, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) | 33.7  | 30.2  | 29.0          |\\n| Under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births      | 42.8  | 19.7  | 13.1          |\\n| Primary completion rate (% of relevant age group) | 95.9  | 97.5  | 99.8          |\\n| Individuals using the internet (% of population)  | 1.7   | 39.5  | 81.0          |\\n| Access to electricity (% of population)           | 99.0  | 99.7  | 100.0         |\\n| Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) | 7.6   | 7.5   | 10.1          |\\n| People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) | 91.3  | 93.5  | 95.6          |\\n| People using at least basic sanitation services (% of population)  | 89.9  | 94.9  | 97.8          |\\n\\nNote: ILO = International Labour Organization, PPP = purchasing power parity.  \\na.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $9.7 billion for 52 operations in the region, including $9.4 billion in IBRD commitments and $269 million in IDA commitments. We signed 14 Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements** with five countries for a total of $13.2 million.\\n\\nTABLE 10: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2024: $33.5 billion.\\n\\nImproving education and health services  \\nIn the last decade, nearly 13 million people across the region have benefited from our 40 education projects totaling $5 billion in commitments. In Guyana, projects totaling $90 million are tackling inequalities at all educational levels to meet new and growing labor market demands. Over 7,000 secondary students have benefited so far, and more than 1,000 teachers have received training. Our Learning can’t wait: Lessons for Latin America and the Caribbean from PISA 2022 report, produced jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank, tackles the learning crisis affecting adolescents in the region, one of the most severe educational crises in the last 100 years.\\n\\nIn Chile, we are expanding access to primary health services through a $200 million project. And in the Dominican Republic, a $150 million project seeks to improve the quality of public healthcare services provision, especially for maternal and neonatal care, and to strengthen health and social assistance systems. Our Health at a Glance: Latin America and the Caribbean report analyzed the climate resilience of health systems in 11 countries across the region.\\n\\nInnovating for a greener future in Uruguay and Chile  \\nWith support from the World Bank, Uruguay has become a pioneer in the development of financial instruments to address climate change. In November 2023, we approved a $350 million loan for Uruguay, as part of the Environmental Goal-Driven Financing Mechanism, that marks a global first by linking multilateral development bank financing conditions with the achievement of ambitious environmental targets. Uruguay could see a reduction of up to $12.5 million in interest on this loan if it attains a verifiable decrease in the intensity of methane gas emissions from livestock production.\\n\\nIn Chile, which is rich in renewable resources, we have approved a $150 million investment to promote in-country green hydrogen projects. This is our first loan to promote green hydrogen to support climate change mitigation efforts. Chile expects to produce the lowest-cost hydrogen in the world by 2030 and to be among the world’s top three hydrogen exporters by 2040.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows two people wearing hard hats and safety vests inside an industrial setting.

Our Regional Gender Action Plan (2021–2025) sets out an approach to narrow persistent gender gaps in the country level. In Ecuador, we approved a $500 million loan to foster inclusive and sustainable development by protecting the most vulnerable and supporting gender equality in all economic sectors.\\n\\nFostering climate resilience and a green transition  \\nWe are bolstering the region’s resilience to climate change and helping countries advance their energy transition agendas. In Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, the Global Program for Resilient Housing identifies houses vulnerable to natural disasters, determines which ones can be made safer before it is too late, and connects the homeowners with government subsidies and private capital. In Peru, two projects totaling $1.5 billion are supporting climate change adaptation and a greener economy. In Panama, we are supporting reforms to enable the energy transition and inclusive low-carbon growth, benefiting the most vulnerable populations. And in Colombia, a $750 million loan to support equitable growth also aims to protect wildlife and reduce deforestation. In fiscal 2024, we published Country Climate and Development Reports with recommendations for sustainable development for Colombia and the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nPromoting formalization of entrepreneurs  \\nIn Ecuador, the Inclusive and Sustainable Growth Program has supported the introduction of a new type of company modality in the legal framework. The new simplified corporation form, S.A.S., has become the most popular vehicle for starting a business in Ecuador. As of fiscal 2022, more than 58,700 S.A.S.s have been registered in the country, representing approximately 80 percent of total companies. This success is replicated in El Salvador, with over 800 companies registered during the first five months of implementation of the S.A.S. this year, and 1,821 registration processes initiated online.\\n\\nCollaborating for sustainable prosperity and digital development  \\nWith the Inter-American Development Bank, we have embarked on a first-ever, four-year partnership to better combat poverty, create jobs, and address climate change. We have committed to work jointly in three priority areas. In the Amazon, we will support countries in their transition to net zero deforestation; help improve the livelihoods of their inhabitants, mostly Indigenous Peoples; and preserve the ecosystem. In the Caribbean, we will focus on supporting disaster risks and climate-crisis management, as well as on developing mechanisms for financial protection against future shocks. We will also bridge the digital divide across the region by collaborating on digital infrastructure and rural connectivity, especially for education.\\n\\n**COUNTRY IMPACT**\\n\\nArgentina: Our flood protection measures have benefited more than 6 million people by safeguarding their communities and infrastructure.\\n\\nEcuador: We financed the fully electric Quito Metro Line, which is expected to annually reduce emissions by 57,000 tons of CO2 equivalent, and save $50 million in fuel costs.\\n\\nJamaica: Our emergency response and risk reduction projects have benefited 57 percent of the population since 2016, enhancing resilience and preparedness in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nFigure 8 illustrates the share of total spending, $9.7 billion, across various sectors in Latin America and the Caribbean for fiscal 2024.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $4.6 billion for 17 operations in the region, including $4.2 billion in IBRD commitments and $340 million in IDA commitments. An additional $87.5 million in special financing was approved for projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Revenue from Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements reached $41.5 million for strategic and technical assistance on sustainable social, economic, and environmental reforms.\\n\\nStrengthening human capital: Health, education, and social protection services\\nIn fiscal 2024, we continued to prioritize human capital development, including in countries experiencing fragility, conflict, or violence. In Yemen, we are enabling the delivery of essential health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene services through additional financing of $150 million for the Emergency Human Capital Project. Implemented by UN partners, this project is expected to benefit at least 19 million people, of whom 10 million are women and girls. We also approved an additional $150 million for the Emergency Social Protection Enhancement and COVID-19 Response Project in Yemen. This third round of financing will help millions of Yemenis as they address the chronic food insecurity and vulnerability exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, economic instability, and climate-related shocks.\\n\\nMobilizing emergency support in Morocco\\nIn September 2023, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck in the High Atlas Mountain range in Morocco, killing more than 2,900 people and affecting over 300,000 people in Marrakech and surrounding areas. The World Bank, which has a robust 65-year partnership with Morocco, reacted quickly to support the country's post-disaster response. We conducted a rapid assessment of the damage and supported the Government to quickly disburse funds to affected people through an insurance regime, the Solidarity Fund, that had been pre-arranged with our support prior to the disaster.\\n\\nOur lending portfolio in Morocco for disaster risk management and financing totals $580 million over the past five years. These funds have been instrumental in improving the institutional framework to scale up disaster risk reduction activities and strengthen financial resilience to natural disasters for the entire Moroccan population.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 12: MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\n|                   | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |\\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\\n|                   | FY22      FY23      FY24  | FY22      FY23      FY24    |\\n| IBRD              | 4,135     4,697     4,233 | 3,407     2,964     3,332   |\\n| IDA               | 817       561       340   | 559       552       587     |\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June  30, 2024: $276 billion.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a group of people, including women and children, standing outdoors.

Working with the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the UN Children’s Fund, the grants support the delivery of emergency food, water, and medical supplies. In the West Bank, we approved a $13 million grant for the continuation of education for children, $22 million to support municipal services, and $45 million to strengthen healthcare and hospital services.\\n\\nEnabling green and inclusive growth\\nTo help policymakers in the region advance their climate change and development goals, we published Country Climate and Development Reports for the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, and Tunisia. In Libya, the catastrophic flooding in September 2023 devastated eastern localities, particularly the city of Derna. The World Bank, together with the UN and the European Union, produced a Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment to inform recovery and reconstruction efforts.\\n\\nWe signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Islamic Development Bank to promote further collaboration between our institutions. The MoU focuses on joint knowledge and operational engagements around the energy, food, and water nexus, climate impact, empowering women and youth to engage with the private sector, and advancing the digital transition and regional integration. The MoU aims to achieve a co-financing volume of $6 billion through 2026, 45 percent of which has already been met.\\n\\nExpanding economic opportunities for women\\nThe World Bank has drawn on a variety of instruments to support Jordan’s commitment to increase female labor force participation, including through the recently approved Country Partnership Framework. Through operations, technical assistance (such as Mashreq Gender Facility; Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative; and the Women, Business and the Law report), and policy dialogue, we have contributed to legal reforms in Jordan that removed job restrictions on women, prohibited gender-based discrimination in the workplace, and criminalized sexual harassment in the workplace. In fiscal 2024, we approved the first women-focused Bank project in the region: the Enhancing Women’s Economic Opportunities Program for Results aims to improve workplace conditions, increase financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, make public transport safer, and increase access to affordable, quality childcare services.\\n\\nAnalysing critical infrastructure needs\\nWe published an Interim Damage Assessment for Gaza in partnership with the UN and with financial support from the EU. This found that a preliminary estimate of the cost of damages to critical infrastructure from the conflict in Gaza between October 2023 and the end of January 2024 was around $18.5 billion—equivalent to 97 percent of the 2022 GDP of the West Bank and Gaza combined. When the situation allows, a full-fledged Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment will be conducted.\\n\\n**COUNTRY IMPACT**\\n\\nEgypt: The Bank-supported Takaful and Karama social protection program has reached 4.7 million vulnerable households, benefiting approximately 20 million individuals, 75 percent of them women.\\n\\nLebanon: A roads project has rehabilitated over 500 km of roads in 25 districts across the country and generated 1.3 million labor days for Lebanese workers and Syrian refugees.\\n\\nMorocco: Our programs have benefited more than 400,000 people directly, and more than 33 million people indirectly, through more than 230 disaster risk reduction projects.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nFigure 6 is a pie chart that illustrates the IBRD and IDA lending by sector for the Middle East and North Africa region in fiscal 2024.

In fiscal 2024, the World Bank approved $9.4 billion for 35 operations in the region, including $3.2 billion in IBRD commitments and $6.2 billion in IDA commitments. We also supported 59 advisory services and analytical products for eight countries, totaling $62.8 million.\\n\\nBoosting water security for a climate-resilient future\\nOn average, 60 million people a year in South Asia have been affected by natural disasters since 2010. We are helping affected communities with investments that build resilience and improve productivity. In India, a new $300 million project will provide more and better access to water and sewer services to around 2 million people in 21 cities. In Bangladesh, we committed $102 million to support an economic corridor along the Jamuna River to enhance the livelihoods of residents and protect the unique ecosystem. In Pakistan, we committed just over $71 million in additional financing to continue supporting flood control and climate resilience in the highly vulnerable Sindh province, which bore the brunt of catastrophic floods in 2022. The Afghanistan Water Platform, which we co-chair with the UN, coordinates in-country humanitarian assistance and investments in water-related basic needs.\\n\\nCatalyzing India’s low-carbon energy transition\\nAs one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies, India is at a pivotal juncture in its development. While India’s per capita energy consumption is just one-third of the global average, its energy demand is expected to grow rapidly as the economy expands.\\n\\nIndia has set a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, a vision that requires a transformative shift to phase down fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is a core technological innovation that can shift energy-intensive sectors like cement, fertilizer, and steel to a low-carbon path. India aims to develop a green hydrogen industry to create jobs and boost energy security.\\n\\nThe World Bank is supporting this transition with two development policy operations worth $3 billion. This strategic financing is designed to catalyze India’s development of low-carbon energy across three interconnected areas: the emergence of a green hydrogen industry, the expansion of renewable energy, and the mobilization of climate finance.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 14: SOUTH ASIA  \\nREGIONAL COMMITMENTS AND DISBURSEMENTS—FISCAL 2022–24\\n\\n|                | COMMITMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |      | DISBURSEMENTS ($ MILLIONS) |      |\\n|----------------|--------------------------|------|----------------------------|------|\\n|                | FY22                     | FY23 | FY24                       | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\n| IBRD           | 4,781                    | 3,143| 3,129                      | 3,192| 3,290| 4,381|\\n| IDA            | 4,217                    | 5,770| 6,239                      | 4,202| 4,646| 5,153|\\n\\nPortfolio of operations under implementation as of June 30, 2023: $55.0 billion.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSupporting the transition to low-carbon and renewable energy\\n\\nWe are working with countries across the region to help them achieve their emissions-reduction goals and increase the share of renewables in their energy mix. In Bangladesh, we have committed $300 million to improve the efficiency of gas distribution and reduce methane emissions along the natural gas value chain. In Pakistan, we committed $1 billion to support the completion of a large hydropower project as part of our broader support to renewable energy generation. In Nepal, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Asian Development Bank to strengthen the country’s hydropower sector through joint financing and advisory services. In Bhutan, we provided technical assistance to help establish rules and procedures for participation in carbon markets so the government can monetize emission reduction credits from hydropower and other renewable natural resources.\\n\\nEnabling jobs to foster equality, prosperity, and resilience\\n\\nSouth Asia is not creating enough jobs to keep pace with its rapidly growing working-age population. Our latest South Asia Development Update shows that private investment and robust growth of businesses and firms are essential to create the number and quality of jobs the region needs. To help close this gap, we are supporting countries through critical policy reforms, skills programs, and analytical work.\\n\\nFollowing the economic crises in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, we are supporting a series of reforms to put both countries on a more sustainable growth path by boosting competitiveness and laying the foundation for a private-sector-led recovery and job creation. A critical area of focus is on increasing women’s labor force participation as only one in four women in South Asia are currently in the workforce.\\n\\nCOUNTRY IMPACT\\n\\nBangladesh: With our support, girls now account for more than half of all secondary school enrollment and in the past six years, female labor force participation increased from 36 percent to 43 percent.\\n\\nMaldives: We are helping install 53.5 megawatts of solar panels on the islands and on the open ocean to create 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and upgrade the electricity grid to include cleaner energy sources.\\n\\nPakistan: We helped double revenue collection at the provincial level in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—from $99 million in fiscal 2019 to $216 million in fiscal 2022—through improved governance and fiscal management.\\n\\nWe also support inclusive skills programs to better prepare people for gainful employment. In Bangladesh, we provided $300 million to equip about 900,000 disadvantaged rural youth—many of whom are female—with skills, alternative education, entrepreneurship support, and employment opportunities. In India, we have committed $195 million to training, upskilling, and providing more than 300,000 people with jobs in high-growth sectors including renewable energy, information and technology services, and hospitality. We have also provided $74 million to India for a jobs-development project with leading private sector companies.\\n\\nFor Bhutan, whose increasingly educated workforce is emigrating at unprecedented rate, we published a report on the national labor market with recommendations to support private sector job creation.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe chart is a pie diagram titled “FIGURE 7: SOUTH ASIA IBRD AND IDA LENDING BY SECTOR · FISCAL 2024 SHARE OF TOTAL OF $9.4 BILLION.” It shows the distribution of lending by sector with percentages labeled around the chart, representing different categories: \\n\\n- Energy and Extractives: 28%\\n- Transportation: 16%\\n- Public Administration: 14%\\n- Information and Communications Technologies: 2%\\n- Industry, Trade, and Services: 6%\\n- Financial Sector: 6%\\n- Health: 7%\\n- Education: 8%\\n- Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry: 2%\\n- Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management: 5%\\n- Social Protection: 10%\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 15: SOUTH ASIA REGIONAL SNAPSHOT**\\n\\n| INDICATOR                                               | 2000   | 2012   | CURRENT DATAa |\\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\\n| Total population (millions)                             | 1,406.9| 1,708.7| 1,938.5       |\\n| Population growth (annual %)                            | 1.9    | 1.4    | 1.0           |\\n| GNI per capita (Atlas method, current US$)              | 442.1  | 1,383.5| 2,338.1       |\\n| GDP per capita growth (annual %)                        | 4.1    | 3.9    | 5.3           |\\n| Population living below $2.15 a day (millions)          | 590.3a | 394.8  | 186.9         |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, females (years)               | 63.9   | 69.5   | 70.1          |\\n| Life expectancy at birth, males (years)                 | 62.0   | 65.9   | 66.4          |\\n| Carbon dioxide emissions (megatons)                     | 1,073.0| 2,147.9| 2,518.4       |\\n| Extreme poverty (% of population below $2.15 a day, 2017 PPP) | 40.4a | 19.9   | 9.7           |\\n| Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods, services, and primary income | 4.1  | 7.4  | 9.9           |\\n| Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%) (modeled ILO estimate) | 35.1 | 34.4 | 41.4          |\\n| Vulnerable employment, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) | 79.6 | 75.3 | 69.9          |\\n| Under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births            | 93.5   | 57.0   | 35.9          |\\n| Primary completion rate (% of relevant age group)       | 67.5   | 84.2   | 99.3          |\\n| Individuals using the internet (% of population)        | 0.5    | 10.1   | 42.6          |\\n| Access to electricity (% of population)                 | 57.9   | 79.5   | 98.3          |\\n| Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) | 49.4 | 37.6 | 37.8          |\\n| People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) | 81.4 | 87.8  | 93.1          |\\n| People using at least basic sanitation services (% of population) | 17.8 | 49.1  | 75.5          |\\n\\nNote: ILO = International Labour Organization; PPP = purchasing power parity.\\n\\na.

We have earned and inherited decades of knowledge through our work, and this new structure makes it easier for us to share it with our clients. In the following section, we describe some of the ways our knowledge improved people’s lives in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nPEOPLE\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\n\\nWe are supporting health, education, and social protection services to improve people’s lives:\\n\\n- We are working alongside partners on social protection programs that reach 500 million people by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women.\\n\\n- As part of our global effort to achieve a shared ambition of care through every stage of a person’s life, we are helping countries deliver quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030.\\n\\n- Our active portfolio has improved schooling for 280 million students, and 137 million women and girls, as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\nHuman capital\\n\\nAs countries deal with multiple global crises, it’s even more important for them to invest in human capital—the knowledge, skills, and good health people need to achieve their potential. The World Bank’s Human Capital Project supports these efforts with a combination of research, data, analytics, and country and global engagement across 95 member economies. Our biannual ministerial conclaves in fiscal 2024 focused on creating more jobs through investing in human capital and on leveraging technology to improve human capital outcomes.\\n\\nOur report, How to Protect, Build, and Use Human Capital to Address Climate Change, recommended engaging leaders to engage people as agents for climate action. We also issued policy briefs on strengthening the links between human capital, gender, and climate.\\n\\nMany of our Bank clients and partners integrate human capital policies as they address crises amid shrinking economies.\\n\\nFinanced by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Canadian government, the Human Capital Umbrella Program provides a flexible financing model that allows donors and partners to support broader, more systematic institutional and policy reforms. Since 2019, it has supported clients in 46 countries in Africa and South Asia with critical investments and technical assistance to address human capital challenges. The program has informed more than 26 Bank operations totaling over $7 billion, reaching more than 57 million people.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a group of young children wearing blue shirts. They are gathered around a water source, and one child is holding a tap, from which water is flowing. The children are actively washing their hands under the running water.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSocial protection and labor systems\\nOver the last two decades we have built social protection programs that are helping more than 280 million poor and vulnerable people in 88 countries with effective social protection to withstand natural and man-made shocks that can exacerbate poverty and food insecurity.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we committed to work alongside partners to reach 500 million people with adaptive social protection by the end of 2030—aiming for half of these beneficiaries to be women. To achieve this goal, we’re utilizing innovative digital cash transfer systems to help those in need receive resources directly and efficiently. Our strategy, The Compass, sets out our vision for universal social protection and guides our involvement, capacity, knowledge, and impact in delivering related programs.\\n\\nDespite progress, coverage gaps persist, necessitating better policies to protect and empower people amid demographic shifts, the green transition, and technological disruptions. In fiscal 2024, we committed an additional $5 billion for social protection, including $2.5 billion from IDA, bringing the total expected portfolio to $28.5 billion. We helped strengthen social registries and electronic payment systems in more than 50 countries and we improved food and nutrition security for 50 million poor and vulnerable households. We also helped communities build resilience against climate shocks and improve their livelihoods through income-generating opportunities.\\n\\nOur 105 jobs and skills training programs, active in 58 countries, empowered youth and women, and we assisted 76 countries to help manage their demographic transition through pension reforms and disability programs. We kickstarted 10 Global Skills Partnerships to support international labor mobility.\\n\\nHealth services\\nStrengthening health systems is essential to achieving progress on Universal Health Coverage (UHC). More than half the world’s population, about 4.5 billion people, lack access to essential health services according to our latest UHC Global Monitoring Report. More than 2 billion people face severe financial hardship paying out-of-pocket for those services.\\n\\nIn response, we have committed to help countries deliver quality, affordable health services to 1.5 billion people by 2030 as part of our global effort to provide a basic standard of care through every stage of a person’s life. The Bank, in partnership with the World Health Organization, is also supporting Japan to launch a UHC Knowledge Hub to enhance healthcare systems in developing countries.\\n\\nOur $29.4 billion global health portfolio includes 169 projects that improve health outcomes, especially for poor and vulnerable people, by strengthening UHC and public health. For example, a new regional health security program in Western and Central Africa is ramping up preparedness and response capacities for health emergencies for more than 620 million people.\\n\\nTo promote data and digital solutions in health systems, we published a report with strategic policy recommendations, Digital-in-Health: Unlocking the Value for Everyone. In response to the rising energy and health impacts of climate change in low- and middle-income countries, we announced a new Climate-Health Program in fiscal 2024 to help countries assess their climate and health vulnerabilities and increase partnerships and investments in climate-resilient health systems. To increase the impact of collective action, a Development Bank Working Group for Climate-Health Finance was established in July 2023 with 11 development banks. The group has already launched a joint roadmap to urgently scale climate and health action.\\n\\nTo improve the health of women, children and adolescents, the Global Financing Facility (GFF), a global country-led partnership hosted at the World Bank, continues to increase financing and technical assistance in GFF partner countries. As of June 2024, the GFF has committed a total of $1.5 billion for grants in 38 countries. Since partnering with the GFF, countries have reached 100 million pregnant women with access to four or more antenatal care visits; 130 million women with safe delivery care; and 630 million women and adolescents with modern contraceptives.\\n\\nTo boost resilience to future pandemics, the Pandemic Fund approved its first round of grants to 37 countries across six regions. In July 2024, the United States pledged up to $667 million, and Germany pledged $554 million to the Fund as it works toward raising at least $2 billion to meet strong demand from low- and middle-income countries. The Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Program Trust Fund allocated $139 million through June 2024 to support 43 country and regional efforts in health emergency preparedness and response. To mitigate the emerging threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we produced an AMR framework for action with recommendations for preventative actions in World Bank operations.\\n\\nEducation and training\\nA learning and skills crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic is hindering foundational learning and skills development, leaving young people unprepared for the workforce. In response, the World Bank is funding projects and research projects—including Education Finance Watch 2023, Building Better Formal TVET Systems: Making Teacher Policy Work, and the RAPID Framework for Learning Recovery to Acceleration—to enable improvements in education systems across the world.\\n\\nWe are the largest source of international financing for education with 149 projects totaling $26.1 billion. We are the largest international financier of education in fragility, conflict, and violence settings through $6.4 billion in active projects. Since 2015, we have managed 63 percent of all project implementation grants of the Global Partnership for Education, totaling $4.2 billion.\\n\\nWe work closely with partners to improve learning and education systems around the world. For example, we co-promote foundational learning through the Coalition for Foundational Learning and the Accelerator Program. The Early Learning Partnership multi-donor trust fund, housed at the World Bank, seeks to improve early learning opportunities and outcomes for young children. We also collaborate with the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel to inform education policies.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Scottish Government joined our foundational Learning Compact Trust Fund to support learning outcomes for children, with a particular focus on inclusive education. We also launched the Tertiary Education and Skills Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund with the Mastercard Foundation to improve access to inclusive, quality, equitable, and resilient education and training.\\n\\nAddressing learning poverty\\nStudents are attending educational institutions but not acquiring the skills they need to succeed in the job market. Officials often underestimate the severity of this crisis and don’t adapt their investment strategies accordingly. The World Bank Group has helped shift the focus from student enrollment to learning and has worked with partners to spur evidence-based action to improve learning. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank's active portfolio has improved educational opportunities for 280 million students, including 137 million women and girls.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nThe image contains a photo, likely of a healthcare or educational setting, showing individuals engaged in work activities.

In fiscal 2024, we:\\n\\n- Started a review with the IMF of the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries to better identify debt vulnerabilities and act before countries fall into debt distress.\\n\\n- Published country poverty and equity assessments that highlight the need to tackle poverty in all its dimensions, including through greater investments in human capital, agriculture, and rural development.\\n\\n- Convened the Private Sector Investment Lab which is working to address the barriers to greater private sector investment in emerging markets.\\n\\nPoverty alleviation\\nAround 700 million people live in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 per day. To help improve their lives, we provide policymakers with economic analyses and work with them to develop policy recommendations. Several of our country poverty and equity assessments in fiscal 2024 highlighted the need to tackle poverty in all its dimensions, including through greater investments in human capital, agriculture, and rural development. Our research assessed how countries can help vulnerable people adapt to risks and protect their welfare in the face of extreme weather events and other shocks. We are also helping countries improve their data for policymaking.\\n\\nWe work with partners to accelerate solutions to fight poverty. For example, we hosted a conference with the international movement ATD-Fourth World and the IMF to address the hidden dimensions of poverty. In partnership with the UN, we analyzed child-poverty trends and found that around 333 million children are living in extreme poverty. We also co-organized an Expert Group Meeting on Sustainable Development Goal 1 to create tangible policy guidance and practical actions to the 2024 UN High-level Political Forum.\\n\\nEconomic policies for growth and jobs\\nWeak revenue collection, higher levels of debt, and global interest rate hikes have pressured development expenditures in low-income countries.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nchallenges. We provide highly concessional financing and innovative financial solutions, including climate-resilient debt clauses and custom hedges. We also work with countries to strengthen their macroeconomic policy framework, mobilize more domestic revenues with equity, and build debt management capacity. To mitigate future debt risks, we have started, with the IMF, a review of the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries and launched a joint initiative to boost domestic resource mobilization.\\n\\nWe also play an active and constructive role in improving the global sovereign debt and tax architectures, working with stakeholders through the G20, the G20 Common Framework, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, and the OECD Platform for International Taxation. We support IDA countries to address debt vulnerabilities by strengthening debt and fiscal management through the complementary Sustainable Development Finance Policy.\\n\\nAs part of the Knowledge Compact, we started revamping our analytical products to better inform and increase the impact of our operations. We are piloting a new Public Finance Review, which now goes beyond public expenditures to analyze tax policies, and are upgrading the Country Economic Memorandum into the Growth and Jobs report to emphasize the urgency of creating more and better jobs across our client countries. Our work on economic modeling of climate change and tax policies to support the green transition also helps inform the Bank׳s climate change agenda.\\n\\nThe World Bank also publishes research and analysis to increase understanding of development policies, and programs. Our report, The Great Reversal: Prospects, Risks, and Policies in International Development Association Countries, offers the first comprehensive look at the opportunities and risks confronting the 75 countries eligible for IDA resources. Our International Debt Report is published annually, while the Global Economic Prospects report and The Commodity Markets Outlook are published twice a year.\\n\\nFinancial stabilisation\\nWe are helping governments improve the incentives for raising private capital for green investments and enhancing available information for investors interested in environmental objectives. This includes setting standards for sustainability-linked bonds.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we enhanced financing from the Access to Finance for Recovery and Resilience Project through the Government of Rwanda to provide a collateralized first-loss credit enhancement for the national development bank's bond issue. Instead of offering the typical line of credit, we worked with the government to deploy roughly a third of $297.5 million project funding as credit enhancements and enable the bonders from capital markets. This made it possible for private markets to finance small- and medium-sized enterprises. We have also financed risk capital to leverage private capital via Angola, Kenya, and Mozambique.\\n\\nWe continue to promote digital financial services as a driver of financial inclusion in developing economies, including through Project FASTT (Frictionless Affordable Safe Timely Transactions).\\n\\nStrong public institutions\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank continued to help countries strengthen their public institutions, i.e., core government functions. For example, we expanded our Climate Change Institutional Assessment series, updated the Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators database, and published the Government Analytics Handbook for public sector managers. We also launched an Anticorruption Lab and published a policy paper on Beneficial Ownership Registers.\\n\\nWe published an assessment of Liberia's judiciary (JUPITER) and are assessing the effectiveness of judiciaries in other countries. To promote the digitalization of government services, we published toolkits including Greening GovTech and GovTech in Fragile and Conflict Situations. We also published the Revenue Administration Handbook for policy makers and practitioners.\\n\\nThe Financial Management Umbrella Program and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Program, whose Secretariat is housed in the World Bank, continued to deliver results. In fiscal 2024, 30 PEFA assessments were completed. 11 of which involved the participation of World Bank teams. We also published the fourth Stocktaking of Public Financial Management Diagnostic Tools report.\\n\\nWith our client countries, we worked to mainstream gender considerations into fiscal policy and budget systems. In fiscal 2024, around $1.6 billion was mobilized through IBRD, IDA, and borrower co-financing to support Nigeria, Tanzania, and Togo in integrating gender considerations into their fiscal management systems. We are also advising the Democratic Republic of Congo, Grenada, Indonesia, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Ukraine on similar reforms. We continued supporting countries to improve public procurement policies and practices, and published a report, Drivers of Delays in Procurement of Infrastructure Projects.\\n\\nEnabling private investment\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank increased its support to client countries to enable business environments, strengthen private sector competitiveness, and promote the green transition of industries. Private investment plays a pivotal role in augmenting the productive capacity of economies, and creating more and better job opportunities, especially in IDA countries. In this context, Investment Climate Assessments and 2.0 diagnostics have been undertaken in nearly 20 countries, identifying and prioritizing policy reforms to unlock more private investment.\\n\\nOur Private Sector Investment Lab is working to address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets. Since the Lab's launch in 2023, private sector leaders have provided the World Bank Group with valuable feedback that has helped us better align our strategies, with a view to increasing the speed and scale of private finance, ultimately leveraging more private capital for development.\\n\\nWe also launched The Business of the State report which proposes five key principles for effective government engagement with state-owned enterprises. Our work also helped client levels the playing field between state-owned businesses and private sector players, strengthen the policy environment (e.g., policy reforms in Kenya, Morocco, and the Philippines), accelerate industrial decarbonization (e.g., via ecoindustrial parks and support to innovation in Türkiye), and address key sectoral constraints (e.g., sustainable tourism development).\\n\\nTrade facilitation\\nIn fiscal 2024, our research explored the impact of government subsidies on trade and how the global cost-based trading systems can respond. Our trade facilitation and logistics experts advised clients on how to deploy digital solutions to speed the movement of goods across borders and through ports, thereby cutting trade costs and carbon emissions from existing volumes. Our quarterly Trade Watch series tracks disruptions to maritime shipping and our analysis on trade and climate is helping client countries meet their emissions-reduction targets while remaining integrated in global value chains.\\n\\n52 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024                              THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 53\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThere are two images on the pages. \\n\\n1.

GFDRR released reports on Assessing the Benefits and Costs of Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience and Building Regulations in Sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\nAgriculture and food\\n\\nBuilding on the $45 million World Bank response to the food and nutrition security crisis, our global programs focused on advancing food systems' transformation toward productivity, resilience, and sustainability. Leveraging IDA and IBRD resources, the Food Systems 2030 Umbrella Trust Fund has committed $676 million in fiscal 2024, with cumulative commitments totaling $1.584 billion. In 56 countries, 128 grants are financing analytics and pilot investments that strengthen preparedness for food crises and pandemics, repurpose agricultural expenditures toward sustainability, and mainstream climate-smart agriculture practices, and digitize agriculture services. This includes $95 million in recipient-executed grants to reorient public expenditures toward more efficient and sustainable agriculture development in seven countries: Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we also published our Recipe for a Livable Planet report, the first comprehensive global roadmap to mitigate the agrifood systems’ climate impact, and established that $260 billion a year is needed for agribusinesses to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At the regional level, we published Greening Agriculture in the Western Balkans, which examines how the green transition can align with the EU's environmental and climate goals.\\n\\nNature and biodiversity\\n\\nThe World Bank supports countries to protect natural capital, grow and diversify businesses around natural assets, and share the benefits through jobs and other livelihood improvements.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we launched our innovative Blue Carbon, Readiness Framework to expand options for countries to tap into the potential of mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses to fight climate change.\\n\\nWe mainstream nature across our work, including through our Environmental and Social Framework. In Fiscal 2024, we published a Nature Finance Tracking Methodology to systematically capture contributions to nature.\\n\\nWater security\\n\\nWe improved water security for nearly 400,000 farmers to date by co-financing the Sahel Irrigation, Initiative Support Project. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are providing safe drinking water to nearly one million people in the capital, Kinshasa, helping the Second National Ganga River Basin Project directly benefitted 3.7 million people—adding over 2,600 km of sewer network with over 317,000 house connections— and prevented 404 million liters per day of untreated wastewater flowing into the Ganga.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we published two new reports: Water for Shared Prosperity, with recommendations to improve water security and strengthen climate resilience; and Funding a Water-Secure Future: An Assessment of Global Public Spending, the first-ever attempt to create a comprehensive view of public financing and funding gaps in the global water sector. In collaboration with our partners, we introduced the Strategic Framework for Scaling Up Finance for Water to mobilize investments at critical times with climate goals, leveraging private sector expertise and capital for strategic, cross-sectoral action. Additionally, we partnered with the government of Singapore to launch the Singapore Water Center, a hub for innovation, knowledge exchange, capacity development, and a key pillar of the World Bank Group Academy.\\n\\nSocial inclusion and sustainability\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we expanded platforms to build partnerships for development that go beyond government and the private sector to bring in communities and civil society. We reviewed evidence and impacts of community-led approaches to identify strengths and next steps. We partnered with civil society on a Green Accountability initiative to enable more transparent, accountable, and effective investment of funds to combat climate change. And we strengthened the Bank’s support for building client capacity to manage social conflicts around development, including through a new offering in the World Bank Group Academy.\\n\\nINFRASTRUCTURE\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\n- We are working to improve energy systems, roads, and bridges.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we launched innovative new programs to meet global energy challenges. The Europe and Central Asia Renewable Energy Scale-up Program will enhance renewable security and affordability over 10 years, providing 15 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity and reducing 240 million metric tons of carbon emissions in the region. The Accelerating Sustainable and Clean Energy Transition Program will put 20 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa on the path to universal energy access, providing sustainable and clean energy access to 100 million people by 2030. This work supports our ambition to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in partnership with the African Development Bank. The expected private sector investment opportunities in distributed renewable energy alone will be worth roughly $9 billion.\\n\\nWe launched the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement Partnership to diversify mineral supply chains and help low- and middle-income countries capture a larger share of the growing demand for minerals. The Hydrogen for Development Partnership, founded and supported by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, facilitated $1 billion in concessional financing in fiscal 2024—the largest hydrogen engagement among all multilateral development banks—to ramp up clean hydrogen projects in India. We released the report The Critical Link: Empowering Utilities for the Energy Transition, with recommendations on how to assess utilities’ ability to deliver reliable, clean, and affordable power.\\n\\nOver the past three decades, we have provided more than $3 billion to help governments close coal mines and power plants while protecting workers and the environment. Our work on the just transition in coal regions is one of five priorities under the World Bank Group’s Climate Change Action Plan for 2021–25. We also work with governments and the private sector to reduce emissions and in December 2023, we launched the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Partnership, a $255 million fund to help developing countries cut carbon dioxide and methane emissions generated by the oil and gas industry.\\n\\n**Infrastructure finance**\\n\\nInfrastructure connects people with employment opportunities, promotes economic growth, and improves livelihoods. It also impacts our planet’s livability, as infrastructure both generates climate-changing emissions and is vulnerable to climate change effects. Transitioning to sustainable infrastructure demands trillions of dollars, but with government budgets often stretched thin, innovative financing and private sector investment are essential to bridging the financing gap.\\n\\nOur Private Participation in Infrastructure report noted that infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries totaled $96 billion in 2023, representing a 5 percent decrease from 2022, but on par with the previous five-year period. In response, we are leveraging the full suite of our financing instruments to remove the constraints blocking private sector investment. In fiscal 2024, we announced a major overhaul of our guarantee business with the goal of boosting annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030. This will help mitigate risk and catalyze private finance in development projects.\\n\\n**Sustainable and resilient transport**\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we lent more than $5 billion to 33 new projects addressing road safety, logistics, climate-resilient connectivity, and decarbonization. The Global Facility to Decarbonizing Transport welcomed Spain as a new member and received $3.8 million in funding, bringing the group’s total pledged funding to just over $13 million.\\n\\nSeveral of our projects launched in fiscal 2024 following years of collaborative development. In December 2023, Metro Line One opened to the public in Quito, Ecuador. Funded in part by the World Bank Group, the metro serves 400,000 passengers daily and is expected to reduce emissions from transport by an estimated 67,000 tons of CO₂ each year. In Dakar, Senegal, an electric-powered bus rapid transit system was launched to serve 320,000 commuters and should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.2 million tons over a 30-year period. Going forward, we will use the World Bank Gender Strategy, published in June 2024, to increase the number of women in transportation leadership roles to equalize the sector.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image depicts a modern cable-stayed bridge spanning a river, with a cityscape in the background. The water is a deep blue, and the surrounding areas are green and lush. There is a marina or dock near the bridge with several small boats.

In fiscal 2024:\\n- Our Digital lending portfolio comprised a record 53 active projects, representing $5.6 billion in total net commitments as of June 2024.\\n- The inaugural Global Digital Summit brought together digital thought leaders, policymakers, and practitioners to explore the emerging opportunities and risks of digital transformation for development.\\n- We created a dedicated Digital Vice Presidency unit within the World Bank to maintain momentum for digital transformation across all sectors.\\n\\nSeizing digital development\\nDigitalization is the transformational opportunity of our time. The critical services that support development—like hospitals, schools, energy, and agriculture—rely on connectivity and data. In low-income countries, billions of people are still offline or lacking digital identification and skills. To close the digital divide, we collaborate with governments in more than 100 developing countries to build strong and trusted foundations and enablers for digital economies to thrive. The Digital lending portfolio comprised a record 53 active projects, representing $5.6 billion in total net commitments as of June 2024. More than a third of commitments (37 percent) were approved in fiscal 2024. Demand from middle-income countries also increased from 5 percent in fiscal 2021 to 24 percent in fiscal 2024, reflecting the recognition of the essential role digital technologies play in climate resilience, economic growth, job creation, and public service delivery.\\n\\nThought leadership and partnerships\\nOur inaugural Global Digital Summit, hosted in March 2024, brought together digital thought leaders, policymakers, and practitioners to explore the emerging opportunities and risks of digital transformation for development. We expanded access to data and knowledge through several publications, including the global flagship Digital Progress and Trends Report, 2023, which highlighted the accelerating pace of digitalization and the potential of artificial intelligence for development. The Green Digital Transformation report highlighted how to make digital transformation sustainable and leverage digital technologies for climate action.\\n\\nWe expanded our group of development partners through several trust funds—such as the Digital Development Partnership, the associated Cybersecurity Multi Donor Trust Fund, the Identification for Development and Government-to-Person Payments initiatives—to accelerate inclusive, safe, and sustainable digitalization.\\n\\nDigital Vice Presidency unit\\nTo maintain momentum for digital transformation across all sectors, we created a dedicated Digital Vice Presidency unit within the World Bank, effective fiscal 2025. The unit will support clients to build digital infrastructure and data platforms; enhance cybersecurity and data protection and privacy; support digital entrepreneurship, skills, and jobs; and implement digital government services.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe image shows a man sitting in front of a laptop, possibly in a work or training environment.

In this section, we detail our work in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nGENDER AND YOUTH\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\nIn fiscal 2024, 95 percent of Bank-financed operations used gender analysis to identify entry points to advance gender equality and measure the impact of specific actions, compared to 50 percent in fiscal 2017. We are investing in young people to help them transition into adulthood and productive employment and in fiscal 2024, we published the first global analysis of the online gig economy.\\n\\nGender\\nThe World Bank Group Gender Strategy 2024–2030 sets out three strategic objectives to achieve gender equality: expand gender-based violence and elevate human capital; expand and enable economic opportunities; and engage women as leaders. Informed by a two-year multistakeholder consultation process, three retrospectives and a series of policy notes, the strategy identifies innovation, financing, and collective action as drivers of change toward gender equality. Our work is focused on investing in women and girls while also addressing the disadvantages facing men and boys and the vulnerabilities arising from the intersection of gender with poverty, ethnicity, disability, and other characteristics.\\n\\nThrough IDA, we tackle challenges at the forefront of gender equality and girls’ and women’s empowerment, including around sexual and reproductive health, childcare, economic inclusion, entry of women into higher-skilled jobs, gender-based violence, and fiscal-policy and budget-system reforms. IDA resources have supported over 300 country-led actions in targeted areas and reached more than 700 million women and girls since fiscal 2015.\\n\\nOur Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE) supports innovative, scalable public and private sector solutions through new evidence and data, mainly in low-income countries and those affected by fragility, conflict and violence. UFGE has influenced over 300 World Bank projects, and shaped policy dialogue and reforms in 105 countries. It has also spurred gender-smart initiatives in over 80 private sector companies, including on women’s leadership and access to housing finance.\\n\\nOur Gender Data Portal makes gender statistics accessible through compelling narratives and interactive data visualizations. Building on resources and guidance produced under the Living Standards Measurement Study-Plus program and the Strengthening Gender Statistics project, it serves as a one-stop shop for global gender data, spotlighting more than 1,000 indicators for 217 economies.\\n\\nOur annual report, Women, Business, and the Law, measures the laws and regulations affecting women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies. The 2024 report found that women enjoy fewer than two-thirds the rights of men, far less than the previous estimate of three-quarters, due to the introduction of new indicators on women’s safety from violence and access to childcare services. No country provides equal opportunity for women, and closing gender gaps could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20 percent—essentially doubling the global growth rate over the next decade.\\n\\nLegal reforms that enhance women’s economic opportunities include prohibiting gender-based discrimination in financial services and products; lifting restrictions on the types of jobs and sectors imposed on women; mandating equity in pay; and establishing leave policies and protection from sexual harassment at the workplace. Our programs supported 14 gender-focused legal reforms in Jordan, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone in 2024.\\n\\nOur programs help women participate in economic activity, promote productive economic inclusion, and work to end gender-based violence. In Zambia, the Girls’ Education and Women’s Empowerment and Livelihoods project has supported about 140,000 women to enhance their livelihoods and close to 150,000 disadvantaged adolescent girls to enroll in secondary school. In Pakistan, the Punjab Resource Improvement and Digital Effectiveness Program supports women’s access to digitalized government services after natural disasters and during public health emergencies, including access to social protection, employment, and sexual- and gender-based-violence support services.\\n\\nThrough our support for the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative and investments by IFC and MIGA, we help unlock financing and support systems for women- and women-led businesses in developing countries. In Panama, IFC’s investment in housing finance for women is increasing the portfolio of mortgages for women, especially low- to middle-income households headed by women.\\n\\nYouth\\nOur work on youth focuses on investing in young people to ensure that they are ready to transition into adulthood and productive employment. Our extensive support for formal education aims to provide youth with the learning and skills they will need to succeed in a rapidly changing labor market. For youth outside of formal education, we support improvements in access to practical skills programs. In Bangladesh, we provided $300 million to equip about 900,000 disadvantaged rural youth—many of whom are female—with skills, alternative education, entrepreneurship support, and employment opportunities. In India, we have committed $195 million to training, upskilling, and providing more than 300,000 people with jobs in high-growth sectors including renewable energy, information and technology services, and hospitality.\\n\\nWe also support job creation and work opportunities for youth through loans and grants. For example, in Madagascar more than 300,000 jobs were created by strengthening the enabling environment for entrepreneurship and by enhancing private investments in productive infrastructure and improved services delivery. Through the $70 million South Sudan Women and Social and Economic Empowerment Project, we aim to help female entrepreneurs formalize and grow their businesses; as well as help survivors of gender-based violence access vital services.\\n\\nIn Kenya, a multifaceted approach—comprising training, internships, apprenticeships, start-up capital, and information provision—has benefited more than 300,000 youth. Our $150 million Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project boosted employment and earnings for youth who have experienced extended unemployment or engaged in vulnerable jobs. Participants received a mix of training, internships, apprenticeships, business start-up grants, coaching, and access to an online one-stop-youth information platform. More than 350,000 youth benefited directly from the project, and 30,000 benefited indirectly, while those previously employed saw a 20 percent increase in their income.\\n\\nAt the intersection of these efforts is the World Bank Group’s dedicated program on youth employment, Solutions for Youth Employment, which brings together donors, governments, foundations, private sector companies, civil society, and youth to support catalytic actions to increase the number of young people engaged in productive work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\n**JOBS**\\n\\n**AT-A-GLANCE**\\n\\nJobs are at the heart of development, and in fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group supported 329 jobs-related projects by leveraging over $6B billion in active commitments.\\n\\nGood, inclusive jobs are the surest pathway out of poverty. The limited availability of these jobs, particularly for women and youth, is a pressing problem. In developing countries, only a third of employment is in the formal sector, and many people work in informal jobs that are low-paying and lack security. With support from the Jobs Umbrella Multidonor Trust Fund, the Bank Group leverages large-scale investment projects to improve job outcomes and support the transition to greener economies, offering dividends for both the environment and workers.\\n\\nIn Zambia, a multi-year project ending in fiscal 2024 boosted market linkages for 32,700 farmers and small and medium-size business owners. This led to respective increases of 27 percent and 73 percent in their sales and mobilized $4.8 billion in private capital. In Burundi, we invested $50 million in approximately 200 companies to increase private early-stage equity finance for innovative small and medium enterprises and create jobs. The project mobilized $58.3 million for early-stage seed capital and venture capital through project investment. A project in Lebanon created 647,000 labor days of short-term jobs for Lebanese and Syrians through investments in road infrastructure, spurring post-COVID economic recovery.\\n\\nThrough the Solutions for Youth Employment task force, the Bank Group supports youth employment and connects stakeholders with over 150 related operations. In September 2023, we published the report Working Without Borders, the first global analysis of the online gig economy.\\n\\n**PRIVATE CAPITAL MOBILIZATION**\\n\\n**AT-A-GLANCE**\\n\\nThe private sector is essential to closing the financing gap in developing countries. In fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group engaged the private sector through platforms such as the Private Sector Investment Lab, Guarantee Platform, and IDA Private Sector Window.\\n\\nEnabling private sector investment and capital flows are core activities and a priority of the World Bank Group. The three pillars of our approach—enabling private capital, building capital investment pipelines, and establishing private capital connectors—provide the blueprint to massively increasing the amount of private capital flowing into developing countries to advance development priorities.\\n\\nThrough the Private Sector Investment Lab, the World Bank Group is forging partnerships with private sector leaders to dismantle barriers impeding investment flows to emerging markets. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform aims to scale political risk insurance to over $20 billion annually by 2030. And the expansion of the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database is making credit risk data more transparent to unlock greater private capital flows.\\n\\nThe IDA Private Sector Window (PSW) leverages IDA’s resources and helps mobilize sustainable private sector investment in the poorest and most fragile markets. With the support of the IDA PSW, the first private equity fund targeted at small- and medium-sized enterprises was introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic, the first utility-scale renewable energy project is being implemented in Djibouti, the first global risk-sharing platform was created targeting Base of the Pyramid financing to reach the poor, and critically needed working capital is being provided to a group of Yemeni companies that produce and distribute basic food staples in the country.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThe left image shows a motorbike rider with a phone mounted on their handlebar at a busy intersection during nighttime in an urban setting with bright lights and moving vehicles. The right image depicts wind turbines placed in a vast, open landscape with clear blue skies, suggesting a focus on renewable energy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nFRAGILITY, CONFLICT, AND VIOLENCE\\n\\nAT-A-GLANCE\\n\\nHelping countries address fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) is central to our work. The World Bank Group's financing for countries affected by FCV stands at an all-time high.\\n\\nBy 2030, nearly 60 percent of the world's extreme poor will be in FCV-affected countries. An estimated 314 million extremely poor people live in 39 countries classified as fragile or conflict-affected. The World Bank Group’s FCV Strategy (2020-2025) guides our efforts to help them.\\n\\nThe Mid-Term Review of the FCV Strategy, published in fiscal 2024, concluded that we engaged in conflict situations—in Afghanistan, Haiti, the Sahel region, Somalia, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Yemen—to deliver basic services to people and protect institutions and development gains. For example, 72 million people in conflict situations benefited from the World Bank's job-focused interventions between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2022. We made significant progress in helping countries include refugees in their development priorities—expanding access to jobs, infrastructure, and services for refugees and their host communities.\\n\\nBank Group financing for countries affected by FCV stands at an all-time high. Average annual IDA financing for fragile and conflict-affected countries has increased nearly fivefold since IDA16, reaching 38 percent of total IDA resources, with more than half of the grants going to countries affected by FCV in fiscal 2024. The IDA20 replenishment will continue to allocate a significant share of resources to fragile and conflict-affected countries through June 2025. Crisis preparedness is a new cross-cutting issue under IDA20, as the poorest countries affected by FCV often experience complex crises. IFC and MIGA also leverage the IDA Private Sector Window to offer support and guarantees to help catalyze private sector investments in fragile economies.\\n\\nIDA support includes the FCV envelope (a top-up in addition to regular IDA allocations), as well as windows to support refugees and host communities, respond to crises (including food security), and promote regional approaches. About $8.8 billion has been set aside for the FCV envelope in IDA20 for eligible countries—an increase of 63 percent compared to IDA19 ($5.4 billion). In fiscal 2024, this includes $1.3 billion to help governments prevent conflicts from escalating. It also includes $252 million to help two countries transition out of fragility, and $179 million to remain engaged in high-intensity conflict settings in two countries. Another $2.4 billion has been set aside for the Window for Host Communities and Refugees in IDA20, with $1.2 billion approved in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nThe State and Peacebuilding Umbrella Trust Fund is the World Bank's leading global trust fund supporting implementation of the FCV Strategy. In 2023, the fund financed 42 grants in 30 countries with a total fund value of $51.3 million.\\n\\nMiddle-income countries host 58 percent of refugees, more than three-quarters of whom tend to stay for more than five years. The Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) supports middle-income countries that host large numbers of refugees. In 2023, $159.4 million in GCFF grant funding was allocated to Benefiting Countries, enabling $1.1 billion in multilateral development bank loans on concessional terms and unlocking a combined total of $1.3 billion. To date, 15.8 million individuals, including at least 6.3 million refugees and 7.2 million host community members, have benefited from GCFF-supported operations in Armenia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Jordan, Lebanon, and Moldova.\\n\\nWe engage with humanitarian, security, and peace partners because successful development in fragile countries requires peace and security. We partner with UN agencies and others to deliver on our development mandate in these countries. In exceptional circumstances, we rely on these partners to help provide basic services to people in conflict situations—with total financing of $9.6 billion to UN partners since 2015.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND CAPITAL MARKETS\\n\\nPromoting sustainable finance and capital markets\\n\\nIBRD has mobilized finance for middle-income countries for more than 75 years, raising over $1 trillion from private investors since issuing its first bond in 1947. In fiscal 2024, IBRD, which is rated triple-A by the major credit rating agencies, raised $53 billion through Sustainable Development Bonds issued in a variety of structures and maturities. IBRD is the largest issuer of sustainable bonds and uses the funds raised from capital markets to support development activities in member countries. Please see the World Bank's annual Impact Report for more information about how funds raised in the capital markets support IBRD-financed projects. IDA also issues Sustainable Development Bonds to scale up its development impact and in fiscal 2024, issued approximately $12 billion in bonds.\\n\\nSustainable development through capital markets\\n\\nAs part of their efforts to mobilize capital from financial markets, IBRD and IDA continued to work with bond investors in fiscal 2024 to explain the mainstreaming of climate action and integration of climate and sustainability throughout our work. We also exchange perspectives with investors on development priorities such as biodiversity, education, nutrition, road safety, and water.\\n\\nEnabling sustainable finance markets\\n\\nThe World Bank Treasury's Sustainable Finance and ESG Advisory Services Program provides technical assistance to emerging markets to develop greener and more sustainable capital markets and financial systems, facilitate market-based financial solutions, and mobilize private sector capital toward environmental and social priorities. In fiscal 2024, we worked in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank to help Brazil issue its first sovereign sustainable bond. Proceeds from the €2 billion bond will fund deforestation control, biodiversity conservation, and programs to combat poverty and fight hunger. We provided technical assistance to the Government of Romania to facilitate its first sovereign green bond (EUR 2 billion), the largest ever euro-denominated green bond issued by an emerging market sovereignty. The proceeds will fund green transport projects, infrastructure for disaster resilience, and reforestation plans. With our technical assistance, Viet Nam's BIDV (Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam)—a state-owned financial institution and Viet Nam's oldest bank—became the first bank in Viet Nam to successfully issue a green bond in the domestic market.\\n\\nInnovating for a livable planet\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, we developed the performance-linked impact-linked climate action and financial benefits. Uruguay, the first beneficiary of this product, could see a reduction of up to $12.5 million in interest payments over the life of a $350 million loan, as it achieves pre-determined reductions in methane emissions from beef production.\\n\\nWe helped over 20 countries manage financial risk for a total amount of $13.4 billion. For example, we helped the Philippines protect itself against interest-rate volatility by fixing the interest rate on almost its entire IBRD U.S. dollar portfolio. We also adjusted our pricing for IBRD loans in Japanese yen as of April 1, 2024, thereby enhancing the terms available to our clients.\\n\\nSecuring shareholder endorsement for new instruments\\n\\nWe received significant endorsement for our new financial instruments to boost lending capacity and enable us to take on more risk for shared global challenges with cross-border externality benefits. Our new World Bank Group Guarantee Platform, launched in July 2024, aims to boost our guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030 by bringing together expertise and products from across the Bank Group. Our Livable Planet Fund, launched in April 2024, offers governments, philanthropies, and other partners an opportunity to contribute to our concessional resources for middle-income countries.\\n\\nIn April 2024, a set of 11 countries announced commitments for the Portfolio Guarantee Platform, hybrid capital mechanism, and Livable Planet Fund totaling $11 billion. IBRD's unique leveraging capability enables the resources contributed through the Portfolio Guarantee Platform and hybrid capital to be multiplied up to six times over 10 years—potentially providing up to $70 billion in unregulated funds.\\n\\nManaging disaster risk through global capital markets\\n\\nAs a part of the expanded Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit, we enhanced our financial products to help countries withstand emergency financing needs. For example, we added Climate Resilient Debt Clauses to IBRD loans and IDA credits that allow eligible small-state borrowers to defer principal, interest payments, and other loan charges to help borrowers deal with the economic shocks of severe earthquakes and hurricanes that meet trigger thresholds. We also improved countries' access to pre-arranged (contingent) financing with new products and increased country limits. Finally, we reengineered our loan and credit mechanisms allowing countries to pay the costs of catastrophe bonds and insurance through Bank financing operations.\\n\\nThe Bank helps countries increase fiscal resilience against disasters by improving their access to the insurance and capital markets. Our Treasury works with governments to prepare or execute risk-transfer transactions before a catastrophic event occurs. In April 2024, we executed two catastrophe bond renewals totalling $745 million, including four Mexico catastrophe bonds providing $595 million in coverage against earthquake and hurricane disaster risks, and one Jamaica catastrophe bond providing $150 million in coverage against named storm risks. As of June 2024, we have helped countries transfer $6.5 billion of disaster risk into international markets. Of this amount, $1.4 billion addressing earthquake and hurricane risks in Chile, Jamaica, and Mexico are outstanding.\\n\\nBuilding capacity and managing assets for the public sector\\n\\nThe World Bank Treasury's Reserve Advisory and Management Partnership supports 76 public asset management institutions worldwide through advisory services, executive training, and asset management services—all through a global network of practitioners. The Bank also manages around $86 billion for trust funds and other official sector institutions. For the $45 billion trust fund portfolio, the Bank developed a sustainable fixed income investment strategy, focused on allocating development partners' capital to securities that are intended to make a verifiable, positive developmental impact.\\n\\nFor more information, visit treasury.worldbank.org.\\n\\nINNOVATIVE FUNDING SOLUTIONS\\n\\nIBRD has continued to structure bonds that provide financing solutions for specific projects, in addition to raising financing for IBRD's sustainable development activities through the broader bonds. For example, in January 2024, IBRD issued a $100 million principal-protected outcome bond, the Plastic Waste Reduction-Linked Bond, to support two plastic waste collection and recycling projects in Ghana and Indonesia. This new innovative bond provides investors with a financial return linked to Plastic Waste Collection Credits, Plastic Waste Recycling Credits, and Verified Carbon Units expected to be generated by the two projects. In addition to reducing plastic pollution and carbon emissions, the projects supported by the transaction help mitigate local pollution and air quality, reduce associated health impacts and costs, and create jobs in often overlooked and marginalized communities.</td>\n",

Our One World Bank Group Partnership Charter, published in May 2024, highlights the principles underpinning our work with partners and reinforces our vision of the partner we aspire to be.\\n\\nOur partnerships take many forms, from multistakeholder dialogues for exchanging insights and shaping initiatives to active strategic collaborations for jointly taking on development challenges. Collaboration maximizes our collective impact, mobilizes more resources more quickly, improves efficiencies, and limits aid fragmentation. In this section we detail our key partnership outcomes in fiscal 2024.\\n\\nMultilateral development banks\\nWe work closely with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to advance shared development priorities. In fiscal 2024, we launched a new Global Collaborative Co-Financing Platform with nine other MDBs to improve coordination among our institutions and with other co-financing partners. In doing so, we aim to fast-track solutions that can change the lives of people in developing countries. Participating MDBs include the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the New Development Bank.\\n\\nG7 and G20\\nWe engage closely with the Group of Twenty (G20) and Group of Seven (G7) to address global challenges. Under the Indian G20 Presidency in 2023, leaders pledged to collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank’s capacity to support low- and middle-income countries and committed to an ambitious IDA21 replenishment. The World Bank Group is leading on the implementation of recommendations from the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework Review and the Independent Experts Group report on strengthening multilateral development banks. Under the Brazilian G20 presidency in 2024, the World Bank Group is supporting the G20 Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty by scaling up social protection programs, generating hunger solutions and coordinating knowledge exchange, and providing country-by-country insights on hunger, poverty, and social protection coverage.\\n\\nUnder the Japanese (2023) and Italian (2024) G7 presidencies, the World Bank Group contributed knowledge and analytical work, as well as operational expertise and advocacy on climate mitigation and adaptation, health, trade, and financial sector issues. At the G7 Summit 2024, leaders welcomed the considerable progress that multilateral development banks had already achieved to be better, bigger, and more effective. G7 leaders committed to delivering innovative instruments such as hybrid capital and portfolio guarantees, which will make it possible to further boost Bank lending by around $70 billion over the next 10 years. G7 leaders also supported a successful IDA21 replenishment.\\n\\nAt the 2023 World Bank Group Annual Meetings, the World Bank and G7 partners launched the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement initiative to support critical investments and jobs in clean energy, particularly in Africa.\\n\\nThe European Union\\nThe Bank Group partners with the European Union (EU) and other development priorities across Africa and in the EU’s neighboring regions. In fiscal 2024, we responded to a closely coordinated one on our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including on Rapid Damage and Needs Assessments. Together with the UN, we agreed to deepen trilateral cooperation in fragile settings and to advance gender equality globally.\\n\\nInternational organizations\\nWe continued to work with UN agencies and other international organizations—including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Office for Project Services, the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization—to strengthen the resilience of countries while also supporting their long-term development. We defined the next phase of our collaboration with UNICEF and the World Food Programme in the fields of human development and food security; undertook a joint visit to Chad with UNHCR to support refugees and host communities; and, through The Pandemic Fund, allocated 19 grants in 37 countries to boost resilience to future pandemics.\\n\\nThe private sector\\nThe Bank Group plays a critical role in building partnerships and creating new opportunities for the private sector. Our Private Sector Investment Lab, launched in June 2023, is working to address financing priorities in private sector investment in emerging markets. The Lab’s 15 Chief Executive Officers and Chairs meet regularly to discuss ideas and most recently informed the development of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nOther stakeholders\\nThe World Bank works with civil society, foundations, think tanks, parliamentarians, and others to find development solutions that achieve efficiency, innovation, replicability, and scale. In fiscal 2024, we built partnerships across four of our six become better Bank, building support for this effort, and capturing their feedback. Many of these partners also advocate for IDA21 replenishment—acting as IDA champions, using their public and private voices to shape its direction and build support, and mobilizing their networks. Our engagement leverages the Annual and Spring Meetings, where we host more than 2,000 civil society representatives for the Civil Society Policy Forum, hundreds of parliamentarians and their staff, and key funders, companies, and thought leaders from around the world. We sought out other key moments, such as the UN General Assembly and COP28, as well as business and philanthropic convenings, to build coalitions around our advocacy and operations. New initiatives this fiscal year included a pilot country-focused forum in Mozambique that brought together local civil society representatives and online participants from Angola, Eswatini, South Sudan, and Tanzania.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, Connect4Climate, a Bank-housed multi-donor trust fund, launched Youth4Innovate to promote exchanges between youth and the private sector that spur green job creation. In addition, our work with more than 400 partners through the Partnership Fund for the Sustainable Development Goals continues to support initiatives that promote investments in environmental, social, and governance approaches and low-carbon development.\\n\\nWorld Bank staff support local and global charities through the Community Connections Campaign. In fiscal 2024, we raised over $13 million in donations, setting a record for global staff participation. We also helped staff respond to disasters throughout the year, raising over $560,000 in response to the earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/en/about/partners.\\n\\n72 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2023 73</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nOPERATIONS\\n\\nBuilding a better Bank\\nOperational enhancements are transforming how we work, allowing us to scale and replicate high-impact projects that address global challenges—and to do it more quickly.\\n\\nWithout compromising quality, the World Bank is on a path to reduce the overall project preparation time to under 12 months by fiscal 2025. The Bank Group's leadership are shaping the process with clear guardrails based on rigorous analyses and consideration, and further engagement on issues of strategic relevance. Through joint country representation, we are unifying country leadership for IBRD/IDA, IFC, and MIGA in 21 countries—giving clients a single point of entry to the entire Bank Group. We created a combined World Bank guarantee business to create a one-stop World Bank Group Guarantee Platform.\\n\\nOur Knowledge Bank initiative is refocusing the Bank not just as a funding mechanism, but also as a knowledge mechanism. The new structure with five themes (People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital) and three departments (focused on outcomes, innovation, and learning) is intended to dismantle barriers to the flow of knowledge both internally and externally. The Knowledge Compact for Action details this approach, with a focus on four areas: new and updated knowledge products, strategic partnerships, enhanced learning, and cutting-edge systems.\\n\\nOur new Scorecard for fiscal 2024–30 was approved by the Board in December 2023. Putting the Bank’s focus squarely on impact, this slimmed-down, focused Scorecard will allow shareholders and clients to clearly see the development outcomes the World Bank Group is supporting. And for the first time, all World Bank Group institutions—IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA—will use the same metrics.\\n\\nEnvironmental and Social Framework\\nOur Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) promotes sustainable and inclusive development outcomes in all our client countries. It strengthens protections for people and the environment by addressing a broad range of environmental and social issues in an integrated manner. It places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement and transparency. We apply it to all investment project financing (IPF) initiated on or after October 1, 2018.\\n\\nThe ESF seeks to strengthen clients’ environmental and social capacity and systems, promotes a risk-based and proportionate approach to environmental and social management, and allows for adaptive risk management responsive to changes in project circumstances. As of end-June 2024, the framework applies to 58 percent of our active IPF portfolio. In fiscal 2024, we introduced measures to further strengthen the implementation of the ESF.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/esf.\\n\\nProcurement Framework\\nIn fiscal 2024, 28,436 contracts worth $14.7 billion* were awarded across 1,468 Bank-financed operations. We continued to build on the foundation of our Procurement Framework by driving culture change and embedding procurement approaches that deliver value for money in the broadest sense, incorporating considerations such as equity, innovation, and sustainability. Effective September 1, 2023, we introduced the inclusion of ‘rated criteria’—non-price factors used to evaluate quality and sustainability—in most international procurement awards.\\n\\nWe developed a suite of Sustainable Procurement Guidance documents, offering practical advice to staff and borrowers to mitigate environmental and social risks in project procurement and promote sustainability benefits. We also issued a joint statement with the Heads of Procurement at other multilateral development banks to promote sustainable procurement initiatives. Additionally, we established Mutual Reliance Agreements to harmonize procurement systems with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/procurement.\\n\\nAddressing risks of sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment\\nThrough the Environmental and Social Framework, we strive to identify and mitigate the risks associated with gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (SEA/SH), in World Bank-financed operations.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, SEA/SH risk identification, mitigation and response approaches were integrated in our operations with pilots and human development. We launched a pilot initiative to address child sexual exploitation and abuse within transportation projects in Nepal and Bolivia. The insights and learning from these pilots will inform the development of additional resources and tools for similar operations in the future.\\n\\nTo promote SEA/SH awareness internally, we continued to run training sessions on the Environmental and Social Framework for sector specialists and trained nearly 500 staff in fiscal 2024. We have also integrated SEA/SH sessions into the broader training on the Environmental and Social Framework, benefiting more than 300 specialists.\\n\\nWe train clients on SEA/SH risk management through regional capacity-building initiatives, and we work with other international financial institutions to combat SEA/SH in development operations. We continue to promote the advancing of the SEA/SH agenda, cooperation and learning among Multilateral Financial Institutions by convening an SEA/SH working group. As part of it, we contributed to the UK Government’s Cross-Sector Progress Report on Safeguarding against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment 2022 to 2023.\\n\\nGRIEVANCE REDRESS SERVICE\\nEstablished in 2015, the Grievance Redress Service (GRS) provides individuals and communities with a robust channel to submit complaints directly to the World Bank if they believe a Bank-supported project has or is likely to have adverse effects on them, their community, or their environment. The GRS facilitates the response to such grievances by ensuring that the issues raised are promptly addressed through sound and sustainable solutions. In fiscal 2024, the GRS received 723 complaints from more than 100 countries, continuing a steady upward trend since its inception in 2015.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/grs.\\n\\nTrust funds and financial intermediary funds\\nTrust funds and financial intermediary funds (FIF), such as the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and the Global Infrastructure Facility, are key categories of private investment, a crucial component for addressing development challenges.\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal 2024, $57.5 billion was held in trust in the form of cash, investments, and promissory notes. Of this, $18 billion was for trust funds and $37.2 billion for FIFs. Trust funds finance about two-thirds of World Bank advisory services and analytics, and 86 percent ($37.1 billion) of total trust fund disbursements went to member countries during fiscal 2020–24. Of this amount, over $8.3 billion was disbursed to IDA and Blend countries (i.e., countries eligible for both IDA and IBRD lending). Contributions to FIFs averaged $10.4 billion annually, while cash transfers to implementing entities remained steady, with an average annual transfer of $8.1 billion over the past six years.\\n\\nIn recent years, as the architecture has evolved, trust funds have become more efficient and purpose-driven, reducing duplication and improving alignment with IDA and IBRD. The Bank’s trust fund portfolio now consists primarily of 72 umbrella programs, and many legacy funds are being wound down.\\n\\nUmbrella programs and FIFs are important arrangements for donors to support global challenges such as climate change, communicable diseases, and food and nutrition security.

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nOur Values, People, and Places\\n\\nOur Values\\n\\nThe World Bank Group’s core values—impact, integrity, respect, teamwork, and innovation—embody what is most important to us as an institution and guide how we work with each other, our clients, and our partners. Our Code of Ethics, which articulates what our core values mean in practice and focuses on behaviors rather than compliance, complements these values. The Staff Directives define the regulations and policies that guard against and prohibit misconduct. We build staff understanding of ethical and compliance issues in the workplace through mandatory e-learning, in-person sessions, townhalls, and other outreach on our core values and Code of Ethics.\\n\\nOur People\\n\\nOur diverse and global talent is our most important asset. At the end of fiscal 2024, the World Bank Group employed 18,300 full-time staff in 140 locations representing 184 nationalities. Women accounted for 54 percent of our workforce, reflecting our commitment to accelerate gender equality. We continually evaluate and improve our employee value proposition to remain competitive.\\n\\nDigital Transformation\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank Group designed an ambitious digital transformation to help us build a better Bank. We developed a framework to use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate, deepen, and sustain development impact and developed an in-house generative AI compatibility. To help staff securely use these technologies to increase their productivity. We also trained more than 75 million cyberattacks.\\n\\nEthics and Internal Justice Services\\n\\nThe Ethics and Internal Justice Services Vice Presidency unit (ELJ) promotes the Bank’s core values and provides comprehensive and coordinated services to address staff workplace issues and concerns. In fiscal 2024, the ELJ continued a new strategy that focuses on educating staff on available resources; speed in resolving their issues; building confidence that the internal justice system is fair and just; and combating the fear of retaliation from using ELJ’s services. By providing staff with advice, guidance, training, and conflict resolution, ELJ reinforces a speak-up culture and positive work environment.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, more than 2,800 staff turned to Ethics and Internal Justice Services for help. ELJ reviewed 191 allegations of misconduct: responded to 1,150 staff requests for ethics advice on potential conflicts of interest or other compliance issues; received 282 cases related to harassment, sexual harassment, or other inappropriate behaviors, and 29 cases related to racism or racial discrimination. ELJ has focused on the prevention of retaliation by strengthening the policies and processes to safeguard staff who report misconduct or engage in other protected activities. In addition, it reached 6,820 staff in fiscal 2024 through training and outreach.\\n\\nStaff Association\\n\\nThe World Bank Group’s Staff Association represents the rights and interests of all staff, no matter what their contract type, to senior management and the Board. In fiscal 2024, the Staff Association Executive Committee entered the first year of its two-year term, with focus areas including compensation and health insurance (particularly in country offices), employment visas, and flexible work.\\n\\nOur Places\\n\\nWe are making significant progress toward our goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to our facilities and food services. As of fiscal 2023, we are exceeding our target to cut GHG emissions from our global facilities by 28 percent by 2026, compared to 2016 levels. We are pushing to meet our emissions reduction target on food served at headquarters by 25 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.\\n\\nWe purchase Renewable Energy Credits equivalent to 100 percent of electricity used at headquarters and offset corporate GHG emissions based on rigorous Bank Group guidelines. All carbon-offset projects come from IDA-eligible countries.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART:**\\n\\nThere are no images or charts to describe on this page.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 16: WORLD BANK (IBRD/IDA) STAFF DATA, FISCAL 2022–24**\\n\\n| INDICATOR                                      | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  | RELATED INDICATORS     |\\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|------------------------|\\n| Total full-time staff                          | 12,778| 13,122| 13,492| GRI 401; SDG 8          |\\n| Non-U.S. based (%) (†)                         | 46    | 47    | 48    |                        |\\n| Short-term consultants/temporaries (FTEs)      | 6,163 | 5,986 | 5,901 |                        |\\n| Diversity index                                | 0.893 | 0.90  | 0.91  |                        |\\n| **------------------------------------**       | **----** | **----** | **----** |                        |\\n| ------- represents the deviation from          | 1.7   | 1.7   | 1.8   |                        |\\n| the gender balance target for a given category†|       |       |       |                        |\\n| Administrative and support staff (%)           | 27    | 27    | 27    |                        |\\n| Entry and junior technical (%)                 | 4.7   | 3.8   | 2.9   |                        |\\n| Senior technical (%)                           | 4.7   | 3.4   | 2.8   |                        |\\n| Managers (%)                                   | 2.9   | 2.1   | 2.8   |                        |\\n\\n| **Average days of training per staff,          | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  | RELATED INDICATORS     |\\n| at headquarters**                              | 2.6   | 2.7   | 2.3   | GRI 404; SDG 8         |\\n| Average days of training per staff, in country offices   | 2.9   | 2.1   | 2.8   |                        |\\n\\nNote: -- = not available; FTE - full-time-equivalent (staff); GRI = Global Reporting Initiative; SDG = Sustainable Development Goal.\\n\\n†Gender balance is defined as 50% men and 50% women, with a +/- 2.75 margin.

We aim to reach 12 percent by 2030. Additionally, we intend to increase the number of women-owned businesses to 15 percent of our total vendors (from a 9 percent baseline in 2023). We continue to lead both private and governmental entities in this benchmark.\\n\\nWe have expanded our diverse-owned business initiative by focusing on countries with significant potential to support disadvantaged and underrepresented suppliers. We also advocate for other global organizations to join us in practicing inclusive procurement to empower diverse businesses.\\n\\n**CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED DISCLOSURES**\\n\\nAs part of this report, the World Bank is issuing its third climate-related financial disclosure (“disclosure”), reaffirming our commitment to transparency about the process around our identification, assessment, and management of climate risks, as well as its incorporation into our governance, strategy, and risk management process.\\n\\nThis disclosure is a step in our multi-year roadmap aimed at aligning our climate and sustainability-related financial disclosures with the standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board, while considering the unique business models of IBRD and IDA. This year’s disclosure highlights our efforts to date and demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our disclosures over the medium term. Please see the full disclosure in the appendices.\\n\\nTwo further reports, the Global Reporting Initiative Index and Sustainability Review, fully detail how we integrate sustainability into our operations and corporate practices. The two reports are available through the Annual Report website.\\n\\n**OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY**\\n\\nGuiding the Institution\\n\\nAll the powers of the World Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, the Bank’s senior decision-making body, according to the Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA. Each member country of the Bank is represented by one governor and one alternate.\\n\\nThe Board of Governors delegates most powers to 25 resident Executive Directors who comprise the Board of Directors for IBRD and IDA. The Executive Directors represent the World Bank’s 189 member countries and are responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank. The Executive Directors select a President, who serves as Chair of the Board. The current Board term is from November 2022 through October 2024.\\n\\nThe Executive Directors oversee the Bank’s strategic direction and represent member countries’ viewpoints on the Bank’s role. They are responsible for providing the Board of Governors with an audit of accounts, an administrative budget, and the Bank’s annual report on fiscal year results.\\n\\nThe Executive Directors’ Steering Committee, on which all Executive Directors serve, meets bimonthly to discuss the Board’s strategic work program. Each Executive Director also serves on one or more of five standing committees, which help the Board discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies and other key documents. In addition, an Ethics Committee provides guidance on matters covered by the Code of Conduct for Board Officials. Through its committees, the Board regularly engages on the effectiveness of Bank Group activities with management and with the independent Accountability Mechanism and the Independent Evaluation Group, both of which report directly to the Board.\\n\\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGE OR CHART**\\n\\nThe image shows a warehouse filled with stacks of boxes and inventory on shelves. There is an individual, wearing a safety helmet, operating some equipment and inspecting the stock. The scene suggests the management and organization of a supply chain logistics operation.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE**\\n\\n**FIGURE 8: COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS**\\n\\n**STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE WORLD BANK’S (IBRD AND IDA) BOARD**\\n\\n- **Audit Committee**\\n  - Oversees the Bank’s finances, accounting, risk management, internal controls, and institutional integrity.\\n\\n- **Budget Committee**\\n  - Assists the Board in approving the Bank’s budgets.\\n\\n- **Committee on Development Effectiveness**\\n  - Assesses the Bank’s development effectiveness, guides its strategic direction, and monitors the quality and results of its operations.\\n\\n- **Committee on Governance and Executive Directors’ Administrative Matters**\\n  - Guides the governance of the Bank, the Board’s own effectiveness, and the administrative policy applicable to Executive Directors’ offices.\\n\\n- **Human Resources Committee**\\n  - Oversees responsibility on the Bank’s human resources strategy, policies, and practices, and their alignment with the institutions’ business needs.\\n\\n- **Ethics Committee**\\n  - Established in 2003 to consider, on an ad hoc basis, matters relating to the interpretation or application of the Code of Conduct for Board Officials.</td>\n",

IEG's recommendations inform the Bank Group's directions, policies, programs, and operations. IEG is independent of the Management of the World Bank Group and reports directly to the Executive Board.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, IEG evaluated the Bank Group's progress against thematic priorities including financial inclusion, IDA’s support for job creation and local participation, and reducing gender inequality in countries experiencing fragility, conflict, and violence. IEG also validated management’s self-assessments of their implementation of IEG recommendations from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2022.\\n\\nIEG closely evaluated the Bank Group's private sector engagement on climate action and IDA’s Private Sector Window, a blended finance facility to support the Bank Group's focus on country-level outcomes. IEG completed Country Program Evaluations on the Kyrgyz Republic and Papua New Guinea. IEG also provided input to major strategy documents, including the Evolution Roadmap and the Knowledge Compact.\\n\\nFor more information and IEG’s annual report, visit ieg.worldbankgroup.org.\\n\\n**Accountability Mechanism**\\n\\nThe World Bank Accountability Mechanism (AM) is an independent body for those who feel harmed by Bank-financed projects. It includes the Inspection Panel (IPN) and the Dispute Resolution Service (DRS). The AM Secretary and the IPN each report to the Board and operate independent of Bank management. Affected communities can submit complaints to the IPN which, if authorized by the Board, conducts independent investigations. The DRS Secretary offers a voluntary dispute resolution process, handled by the DRS. If this is declined or unresolved, the matter reverts to the IPN for investigation.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the IPN received six Requests for Inspection and concluded the investigation of a case from Bolivia which, after Board discussions, led to a Board-approved Management Action Plan that responded to the IPN’s findings. The Board sanctioned an IPN recommendation to investigate a case from Viet Nam, which is now in dispute resolution, pursuant to an offer extended by the AM Secretary. The IPN was conducting an investigation in Tanzania toward the end of the fiscal year, while a decision whether to register two new Requests from Serbia and Pakistan was pending. The IPN did not register cases from India and Pakistan. Concurrently, the DRS facilitated a signed dispute resolution agreement in Cameroon, which is now in post-agreement follow-up and monitoring. The DRS continues to monitor agreements previously reached in Nepal and Uganda.\\n\\nFor more information on the Accountability Mechanism, visit accountability.worldbank.org/en/home and www.inspectionpanel.org.\\n\\n**Sanctions System**\\n\\nThe World Bank Group's Sanctions System addresses allegations of fraud, corruption, collusion, coercion, and obstruction—collectively known as sanctionable practices—in our operations. Based on Integrity Vice Presidency unit (INT) investigations, in fiscal 2024, the Bank Group sanctioned 37 firms and individuals through uncontested determinations of the Bank’s Chief Suspension and Debarment Officer, decisions of the Bank Group Sanctions Board, and settlement agreements. Fourteen entities met their conditions for release and one entity met the conditions for the conversion of its debarment, with conditional release, to conditional non-debarment. The Bank Group recognized 20 cross-debarments from other multilateral development banks, and 29 Bank Group enforcement actions were eligible for recognition by other multilateral development banks. INT investigated 66 cases of alleged fraud and corruption involving World Bank staff and corporate vendors, of which nine were substantiated.\\n\\nFor more information about the World Bank Group's Sanctions System and its annual report, visit www.worldbank.org/integrity. To report suspected fraud or corruption in World Bank Group-financed projects, or by Bank Group staff and corporate vendors, visit www.worldbank.org/fraudandcorruption.\\n\\n**Group Internal Audit**\\n\\nThe Group Internal Audit (GIA) Vice Presidency unit is an independent function reporting to the President and overseen by the Board's Audit Committee. Its assurance and advisory services help the Bank Group to more effectively serve clients.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, GIA’s priority engagements included enterprise risk management; grievances, complaints and whistleblower channels; implementation of the Bank Group’s Climate Change Action Plan; external website governance and security; and management of real estate. GIA continued to advance its Country Assurance and Advisory Program and began developing its Ukraine Oversight Program. GIA partners with bilateral, multilateral, and development organizations to strengthen oversight in challenging contexts, including in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence.\\n\\nFor more information and the Group Internal Audit’s annual and quarterly reports, visit www.worldbank.org/internalaudit.\\n\\n**THE WORLD BANK POLICY ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION**\\n\\nThe World Bank’s Access to Information Policy requires all our information to be accessible to the public, save for specific exceptions. The policy, in tandem with the Open Data Initiative, underpins our commitment to transparency.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank’s official repositories saw close to 56 million document downloads, and over 379,000 pages of archival records were declassified. The policy allows and encourages public inquiries into the Bank's operations, research, financials, and Board proceedings. During fiscal 2024, the Bank processed 598 requests for information, with 80 percent of these requests fulfilled within the 20-business-day standard.\\n\\nFor more information and to submit public access requests for information to the World Bank, visit www.worldbank.org/en/access-to-information.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TEXT:**\\n\\nSTRATEGIC RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank identified eight global challenges to prioritize in the next five years: Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, Fragility and Conflict, Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness, Energy Access, Food and Nutrition Security, Water Security and Access, Ending Digitalization, and Protecting Biodiversity and Nature. Addressing these will be key to advancing our new vision and mission.\\n\\nWe delivered 12 Systematic Country Diagnostics, which identify challenges to and opportunities for development in a member country; 13 Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF), which guide our support to a member country; and 12 Performance and Learning Reviews, which summarize progress made toward CPFs.\\n\\nIn April 2024, the Bank Group adopted a Framework for Financial Incentives to support projects addressing global challenges with positive cross-border impact. The framework gives shareholders the opportunity to make voluntary contributions to IBRD that are leveraged for maximum impact and used to address the most urgent global challenges of our time.\\n\\nFinancing instruments and approaches for countries IBRD and IDA offer a variety of financing instruments and approaches to help countries achieve their development goals. These include:\\n\\n• Investment Project Financing, which helps build physical and social infrastructure and develop institutional capacity;\\n   \\n• Development Policy Financing, which supports policy and institutional reforms, including through policy-based guarantees; and\\n\\n• Program-for-Results Financing, which links the disbursement of funds to the achievement of predefined results.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank approved various operations across these financing mechanisms, with a significant focus on climate co-benefits.\\n\\nWe approved 59 Development Policy Financing operations, totaling $22 billion; 43 Program-for-Results operations, of which there were additional financing, totaling $10.6 billion; and 251 Investment Project Financing operations, of which 65% were additional financing, totaling $36.1 billion. Climate co-benefits reached 45 percent of total commitments, including 30 percent for Development Policy Financing, 13 percent for Program-for-Results, and 58 percent for Investment Project Financing.\\n\\nOur Multiphase Programmatic Approach enables countries to structure long, large, or complex engagements into a set of smaller complementary Investment Project Financing and Program-for-Results operations under one program.\\n\\nThis approach facilitates both vertical programs, which involve in-depth, sustained engagement within a single country, and horizontal programs, which encompass multiple countries, states within a country, or subnational entities. In fiscal 2024, the Bank approved 10 vertical and seven horizontal Multiphase Programmatic Approach (MPA) programs, with up to $6.8 billion and $13.2 billion in program financing, respectively. The total amount of new Program financing approved, including Additional Financing, was $20.1 billion.\\n\\nIn February 2024, the Bank Group expanded the tools it offers countries for crisis response with the Board approval of a new Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit. This toolkit includes an expanded and innovative range of tools to help developing countries better respond to crises and prepare for future shocks.\\n\\nThe expanded toolkit includes a new Rapid Response Option to provide quick access to cash for emergency response by repurposing a portion of their unused Bank financing across their portfolio. This allows countries to swiftly address needs when a crisis occurs. The toolkit includes expanded access to catastrophe insurance and Climate Resilient Debt Clauses that allow eligible small-state borrowers to defer principal, interest, and fee payments for severe earthquakes and hurricanes.\\n\\nThe Bank is now rolling out these tools to countries—with new contingent financing operations approved and Rapid Response Options in place—with the ambition to have new crisis preparedness and response mechanisms in place for up to 50 countries by the end of the year.\\n\\nAdvisory services and analytics\\nIn March 2024, we published the Knowledge Compact for Action, which aims to transform ideas into tangible impact by employing data analytics, research, and best practices to offer clients innovative solutions to complex development challenges. We also reorganized the Bank’s practice groups into five Vice Presidencies units—People, Prosperity, Planet, Infrastructure, and Digital—to operationalize this goal.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, the Bank produced 982 advisory services and analytics products spanning more than 130 countries and addressing critical global topics such as climate change, economic growth and planning, public sector data development and capacity building, public administration, pandemic response, and jobs.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, 64 reimbursable advisory services agreements were signed for a total amount of $173 million in 21 countries. These services are requested and paid for by countries; client states, non-member states, including non-borrowing countries, can request them. Our services provided countries with technical assistance, capacity building, and implementation support on topics such as administrative transformation, social safety nets, energy transition, private sector-led growth, public investment management, and agriculture and judicial sector reform.\\n\\nSupport to small states Small states—countries with populations of no more than 1.5 million—are particularly susceptible to economic shocks, natural disasters, and the impacts of climate change. Disaster-related losses in these countries average roughly 5 percent of GDP a year due to capacity constraints, the small size of their economies, and, in many cases, their remote locations.\\n\\nIn 2023, several small states experienced double-digit inflation, leading to financial tightening and higher international borrowing costs. This has further exacerbated their debt vulnerabilities, with over 40 percent of small states already in debt distress or at high risk of reaching that point.\\n\\nTo help small states address their challenges, we are expanding IDA and IBRD resources. In fiscal 2024, this financing reached $11 billion, almost double last fiscal year.\\n\\nWe also are intensifying our management focus on small states as they grapple with economic shocks and climate change. The Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit and the Climate Resilient Debt Clauses will enable small states, UN Small Island Developing States, and Small States Forum countries to better prepare for and respond to shocks. In fiscal 2024, we published a Country Climate and Development Report for the Maldives. We started work on reports for Comoros and the Western Caribbean. The Small States Secretariat, housed within the Bank, hosts the annual high-level Small States Forum on the margins of the World Bank Group–IMF Annual Meeting. The October 2023 Forum focused on the World Bank’s efforts to assist small states in adapting to climate change.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/smallstatets.\\n\\nBudget management and reforms\\nIn fiscal 2024, the World Bank delivered heightened support to countries facing a multitude of global challenges. This includes, in addition to financing, the advancement of knowledge and analytics at the country, regional, and global levels and bolsters the Bank’s staff presence in the countries we serve. We continuously improve our efficiency and redirect resources to frontline services by applying a rigorous budget discipline and implementing a savings program.\\n\\nAcross the Bank Group, we are boosting our effectiveness by streamlining business-planning and budgeting processes. For example, we cut the corporate budget-preparation process from nine to three months. In the current economic landscape, where financial resources are constrained, the Bank will prioritize efficiency gains and reallocation before expanding additional resources to strategic operational priorities.\\n\\nFor more information, visit www.worldbank.org/smallstates.\\n\\n82 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2024 83 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2023</td>\n",

As the largest multilateral development bank in the world, it provides loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and advisory services to middle-income and creditworthy low- income countries, and coordinates responses to regional and global challenges. In fiscal 2024, new IBRD lending commitments amounted to $37.6 billion for 126 operations, of which eight were IBRD and IDA blended operations.\\n\\nFor monitoring, reporting, and better decision-making about its commitments, the Bank applies a taxonomy of codes to all lending operations to reflect the sectors and themes to which it directs resources. Sector codes reflect high-level groupings of economic activities based on the types of goods and services produced and are used to indicate which part of the economy is supported by the Bank’s intervention. Theme codes reflect the goals and objectives of Bank-supported activities and are used to capture the Bank’s support to the Sustainable Development Goals.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\nTABLE 18: IBRD COMMITMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| REGION                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa          | 1,716 | 1,525 | 2,907 | 2,364 | 2,914 |\\n| Western and Central Africa           | 9     | 500   | 386   | 564   | 1,725 |\\n| East Asia and Pacific                | 4,770 | 6,753 | 5,482 | 6,636 | 6,788 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia              | 5,699 | 4,559 | 5,974 | 10,162| 9,302 |\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean      | 6,798 | 9,464 | 9,407 | 9,828 | 9,463 |\\n| Middle East and North Africa         | 3,419 | 3,976 | 4,135 | 4,697 | 4,233 |\\n| South Asia                           | 5,565 | 3,746 | 4,781 | 4,321 | 3,143 |\\n| Total                                | 27,976| 30,523| 33,072| 38,572| 37,568|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.\\n\\nTABLE 19: IBRD DISBURSEMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| REGION                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa          | 932   | 325   | 2,441 | 1,690 | 3,126 |\\n| Western and Central Africa           | 155   | 132   | 261   | 161   | 240   |\\n| East Asia and Pacific                | 4,679 | 4,439 | 5,439 | 4,350 | 5,492 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia              | 3,100 | 3,625 | 4,580 | 4,833 | 10,574|\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean      | 3,797 | 8,741 | 8,911 | 8,216 | 6,305 |\\n| Middle East and North Africa         | 2,416 | 2,764 | 3,407 | 2,946 | 3,332 |\\n| South Asia                           | 3,158 | 3,665 | 3,129 | 3,290 | 3,481 |\\n| Total                                | 20,238| 23,691| 28,168| 25,504| 33,560|\\n\\nTABLE 20: IBRD COMMITMENTS BY SECTOR, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\n\\n| SECTOR                               | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry   | 1,767 | 1,260 | 3,611 | 3,669 | 2,194 |\\n| Education                            | 1,135 | 2,017 | 1,090 | 1,529 | 2,297 |\\n| Energy and Extractives               | 2,053 | 2,379 | 3,069 | 6,913 | 6,411 |\\n| Financial Sector                     | 3,702 | 3,828 | 1,877 | 2,412 | 3,182 |\\n| Health                               | 3,980 | 2,606 | 6,252 | 3,128 | 4,039 |\\n| Industry, Trade, and Services        | 2,208 | 3,030 | 1,916 | 2,301 | 2,330 |\\n| Information and Communications Tech  | 886   | 773   | 509   | 630   | 1,106 |\\n| Public Administration                | 4,301 | 5,666 | 6,848 | 9,314 | 7,679 |\\n| Social Protection                    | 4,786 | 4,800 | 3,466 | 3,270 | 4,426 |\\n| Transportation                       | 1,323 | 2,273 | 3,036 | 1,249 | 2,122 |\\n| Water, Sanitation, and Waste Mgmt    | 1,834 | 1,891 | 1,782 | 2,359 | 1,784 |\\n| Total                                | 27,976| 30,523| 33,072| 38,572| 37,568|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

IBRD is rated Aaa by Moody’s and AAA by Standard &amp; Poor’s, and investors view its bonds as high-quality securities. IBRD’s funding approach continues to be aimed at achieving the best long-term value on a sustainable basis for borrowing members. IBRD’s ability to intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets to developing member countries is important in helping achieve its goals.\\n\\nIBRD’s approach has enabled it to borrow at favorable market terms and pass the savings on to its borrowing members. Funds not immediately deployed for lending are held in IBRD’s investment portfolio to provide liquidity for its operations. In fiscal 2024, IBRD raised about $53 billion by issuing bonds in a variety of currencies.\\n\\nAs a cooperative institution, IBRD does not seek to maximize profit but to earn enough income to ensure the long-term financial capacity necessary to sustain its development activities. Of fiscal 2024 allocable net income, the Executive Directors approved the allocation of $834 million to the General Reserve and recommended to the Board of Governors the transfer of $515 million to IDA and $500 million to Surplus. From the Surplus (including $100 million currently in Surplus), $300 million is expected to be transferred to the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank and $200 million is expected to be transferred to the IBRD Surplus-Funded Livable Planet Fund, to provide a speedy and strong start to the new Framework for Financial Incentives. As part of its lending, borrowing, and investment activities, IBRD is exposed to market, counterparty, country credit, and operational risks.\\n\\nThe Bank Group’s Chief Risk Officer leads the risk oversight function and supports the institutional decision-making process via dedicated risk committees covering financial and operational risks. In addition, IBRD has put in place a strong risk management framework, which supports management in its oversight functions. The framework is designed to enable and support IBRD in achieving its goals in a financially sustainable manner. One summary measure of IBRD’s risk profile is the ratio of equity to loans, which is closely managed in line with its financial and risk outlook. As of June 30, 2024, this ratio was 21.5 percent, and the cumulative subscribed capital of IBRD totaled $223.1 billion, including $22.5 billion in paid-in capital.\\n\\n**For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/ibrd.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 23: IBRD KEY FINANCIAL INDICATORS, FISCAL 2020–24**\\nMillions of dollars, except ratios, which are in percentages\\n\\n|                  | FY20   | FY21   | FY22   | FY23   | FY24   |\\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| **Lending highlights** |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Net commitments a         | 27,976 | 30,523 | 33,072 | 38,572 | 37,568 |\\n| Gross disbursements       | 20,238 | 23,691 | 28,168 | 25,504 | 33,540 |\\n| Net disbursements b       | 10,622 | 13,590 | 14,876 | 12,736 | 20,115 |\\n| **Reported basis**       |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Income statements        |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Board of Governors–approved and other transfers c | (340)  | (411)  | (354)  | (221)  | (371)  |\\n| Net (loss) income        | (42)   | 2,039  | 3,990  | 1,144  | 2,412  |\\n| **Balance sheet**        |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Total assets             | 296,804| 317,301| 317,542| 332,614| 356,612|\\n| Net investment portfolio | 82,845 | 85,831 | 82,057 | 79,195 | 82,680 |\\n| Net loans outstanding    | 202,158| 218,799| 227,092| 241,041| 260,236|\\n| Borrowing portfolio* d   | 237,231| 253,656| 256,909| 266,828| 287,117|\\n| Total equity             | 40,387 | 48,078 | 55,320 | 60,826 | 63,484 |\\n| **Allocable income**     |        | 1,381  | 1,248  | 806    | 1,312  | 1,849  |\\n| Allocated as follows e   |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| General Reserve          | 950    | 874    | 589    | 921    | 834    |\\n| International Development Association      | —      | 274    | 117    | 291    | 515    |\\n| Surplus                  | 431 f  | 100    | 100    | 100    | 500    |\\n| Usable equity* f         | 47,138 | 49,997 | 50,481 | 53,105 | 54,655 |\\n| **Capital adequacy**     |        |        |        |        |        |\\n| Equity-to-loans ratio (%)| 22.8   | 22.6   | 22.0   | 22.0   | 21.5   |\\n\\nNote: a.

It provides financing in the form of development credits, grants, guarantees, and loans to help these countries increase economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions for those most in need.\\n\\nFiscal 2024 marked the second year of the IDA20 cycle. In light of surge financing and additional volumes provided to IDA countries to address overlapping crises in fiscal 2023, as well as the compounding effect of a stronger U.S. dollar, IDA shareholders approved additional resources amounting to $7.8 billion to bridge the financing gap in IDA20. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors approved a moratorium on hardening of terms for all IDA countries in good standing with the Sustainable Development Finance policy to apply in fiscal 2024 and 2025, until IDA’s Grant Allocation Framework is reviewed during the IDA21 replenishment discussions.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, 75 countries were eligible for IDA assistance. New IDA lending commitments for fiscal 2024 amounted to $23.2 billion for 235 operations, of which eight were IBRD and IDA blended operations. These commitments included $23.1 billion in credits and $8.1 billion in grants. In addition, three projects for $550 million and three subprojects for $194.1 million were approved for support from the IDA20 IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window (PSW) during the fiscal year.\\n\\n**TRANSCRIPTION OF THE TABLE:**\\n\\n**TABLE 24: IDA COMMITMENTS BY REGION, FISCAL 2020–24  \\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS**\\n\\n| REGION                      | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  | FY24  |\\n|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\\n| Eastern and Southern Africa | 9,581 | 14,089| 15,266| 14,368| 12,735|\\n| Western and Central Africa  | 9,054 | 10,955| 12,213| 11,390| 9,274 |\\n| East Asia and Pacific       | 2,500 | 2,115 | 1,673 | 877   | 1,328 |\\n| Europe and Central Asia     | 1,397 | 1,315 | 2,501 | 1,098 | 1,100 |\\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 978   | 659   | 1,030 | 181   | 269   |\\n| Middle East and North Africa| 203   | 658   | 817   | 561   | 340   |\\n| South Asia                  | 6,092 | 7,127 | 4,217 | 579   | 6,239 |\\n\\n**Total**  \\n|                           | 30,365 | 36,028| 37,727| 24,254| 31,195|\\n\\nNote: Amounts are net of full terminations and cancellations relating to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

Excludes IDA-IFC-MIGA PSW activities.\\n\\nIDA financial resources and financial model  \\nIDA is primarily funded by contributions from high‑ or middle‑income partner countries, transfers from other Bank Group institutions, borrowers’ prepayments of earlier IDA credits, and funding raised in the capital markets. In 2016, IDA received its first‑ever public credit rating—triple‑A— which has been reaffirmed by rating agencies annually since then. IDA’s financial strength is based on its robust capital position and shareholder support, as well as prudent financial policies and practices, including a capital adequacy framework. IDA shares the same risk-management governance as IBRD. IDA uses this funding to support an ambitious policy package with special areas of focus and cross‑cutting issues for each replenishment cycle.\\n\\nFor IDA20, a global coalition of development partners agreed to a financing envelope of $93 billion (equivalent to SDR 65.1 billion)* to provide credits, grants, and guarantees to IDA’s client countries. Of this, $84.2 billion is expected to be used on concessional terms: $6.3 billion in IBRD terms for the Scale-Up Window, and $2.5 billion for the Private Sector Window. To help countries address the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, the Bank front‑loaded IDA19 resources to enable IDA to sustain the scale of financing at $35 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, excluding the Private Sector Window; the remaining amount of about $11 billion was carried over into IDA20. IDA has continued to lean forward on deploying resources in fiscal 2024 to help countries deal with multiple crises. As of December 31, 2023, $44.2 billion was committed on concessional terms, $3.6 billion on nonconcessional terms (through the Scale-Up Window), and $1.8 billion through the Private Sector Window. Administrative expenses for IDA are recovered primarily through net charges and interest paid by recipient countries.\\n\\nTo support IDA20, partners are providing $23.5 billion (equivalent to SDR 16.4 billion) in grants, $10.1 billion of which is the grant element from concessional partner loan contributions. Partners are also providing $0.2 billion in concessional partner loans, excluding the grant element, and $1.8 billion in compensation for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative during IDA20. As of June 30, 2024, 57 partners had submitted IDA20 Instruments of Commitment. Total Instruments of Commitment deposited to date amount to $23.5 billion, representing 99 percent of the total pledge amount. IDA’s borrowing program enables it to significantly scale up sovereign support for the Sustainable Development Goals while offering investors an efficient way to contribute to a global development. Under IDA20, the hybrid financial model—which blends donor contributions with market debt—enables IDA to mobilize nearly $4 in development authority for every $1 contributed by development partners.\\n\\nSince its inaugural bond in international capital markets on April 17, 2018, IDA has issued bonds in five currencies: euros, British pounds, Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, and U.S. dollars. In the first half of fiscal 2024, IDA issued approximately $6.2 billion in bonds. IDA continues to broaden its investor base and issued liquidity in various currencies from a diverse set of investors. We will continue to seek opportunities to further diversify IDA’s currency operation and develop its capital markets presence.\\n\\nIn July 2023, IDA’s Board of Governors adopted the decision to establish a Crisis Facility to scale up support for the countries most in need to address worsening development challenges due to the crises of multiple years, particularly food insecurity and extreme climate events. The Crisis Facility has two objectives: 1) to provide additional resources for countries affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a time of compounding, overlapping global crises; and 2) to provide a mechanism for scaling and leveraging contributions for specific countries, including rebuilding Moldova. This facility will support the deployment of partner contributions and will enhance IDA’s financing capacity in addition to IDA20.\\n\\n**TABLE 29: IDA KEY FINANCIAL INDICATORS, FISCAL 2020–24**\\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT RATIOS, WHICH ARE IN PERCENTAGES\\n\\n|  | FY20 | FY21 | FY22 | FY23 | FY24\\n---|---|---|---|---|---\\nLoans, grants, and guarantees\\nNet commitments* | 30,365 | 36,028 | 37,227 | 34,245 | 31,195\\nGross disbursements† | 21,479 | 22,921 | 21,214 | 22,718 | 28,247\\nNet disbursements‡ | 15,112 | 16,465 | 14,477 | 19,986 | 20,062\\n\\nBalance sheet\\nTotal assets | 199,472 | 219,234 | 220,014 | 227,824 | 241,350\\nNet investment portfolio | 35,571 | 37,921 | 39,561 | 30,762 | 33,581\\nNet loans outstanding | 160,961 | 177,779 | 174,490 | 187,669 | 198,457\\nBorrowing portfolio† | 19,983 | 28,335 | 35,032 | 35,393 | 47,028\\nTotal equity | 163,741 | 180,876 | 178,668 | 185,729 | 190,301\\n\\nIncome statement\\nInterest revenue, net of borrowing expenses | 1,843 | 1,996 | 1,901 | 2,367 | 2,398\\nTransfers from affiliated organizations and others | 252 | 544 | 274 | 117 | 291\\nDevelopment grants | (1,475) | (2,830) | (2,372) | (3,946) | (5,291)\\nNet income (loss) | (1,114) | (433) | 12 | (3,262) | (3,573)\\nAdjusted net income | 724 | 394 | 260 | 193 | 780\\n\\nCapital adequacy\\nDeployable strategic capital ratio\\nCurrent Approach† | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 34.8%\\nPrevious Approach‡ | 35.8% | 30.4% | 26.4% | 24.1% | 21.1%\\n\\nNote: For a complete presentation of fiscal year data, see the full financial statements: www.worldbank.org/financialstatements\\n* Commitments that have been approved by the Executive Directors (referred to as “the Board” in this report) and are net of full cancellations and terminations with respect to commitments approved in the same fiscal year.

It is supported by $23.5 billion in contributions from 52 member countries, as well as contributions to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, financing raised in capital markets, carryover from IDA19, internal resources (such as loan repayments), and transfers from IBRD. IDA20 introduced new lending terms for eligible countries: shorter-maturity loans and 50‑year credits.\\n\\nIDA20’s policy framework maintains the four IDA19 special themes: climate change, fragility, conflict, and violence; gender and development; and jobs and economic transformation. It introduces human capital as the fifth special theme. IDA20 will also help deepen recovery efforts through its four cross-cutting issues: crisis preparedness, which was newly introduced for IDA20; debt; governance and institutions; and technology.\\n\\nThe IDA20 period began on July 1, 2022, and was reviewed at mid-term (MTR) in December 2023. The IDA20 MTR showed that IDA20 is fulfilling Policy Commitments (PCs) and is on track to meet or exceed the cycle targets for 83 of 84 PCs, with the remaining three advancing more slowly. IDA-supported operations continued to deliver positive outcomes for people in client countries. According to the Independent Evaluation Group ratings reported in the FY23 Update of the IDA Results Measurement System, the World Bank achieved satisfactory outcomes in 87 percent of IDA-financed operations. At the IDA20 MTR point, the number of IDA client countries that increased to 75 with Sri Lanka’s reverse‑graduation.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we embarked on a journey to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for documents rich in images, graphics and tables. Traditional RAG models, while proficient with textual data, often overlook the wealth of information conveyed through visual elements. By integrating vision models and leveraging metadata tagging, we've bridged this gap, enabling AI to interpret and utilize visual content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by setting up a vector store using Pinecone, establishing a foundation for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. Parsing PDFs and extracting visual information allowed us to convert document pages into images and identify those containing crucial visual data. By generating embeddings and flagging pages with visual content, we created a robust metadata filtering system within our vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uploading these embeddings to Pinecone facilitated seamless integration with our RAG system. Through semantic search, we retrieved relevant pages that matched user queries, ensuring that both textual and visual information were considered. Handling pages with visual content by passing them to vision models enhanced the accuracy and depth of the responses, particularly for queries dependent on images or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the World Bank's **A Better Bank for a Better World: Annual Report 2024** as our guiding example, we demonstrated how these techniques come together to process and interpret complex documents. This approach not only enriches the information provided to users but also significantly enhances user satisfaction and engagement by delivering more comprehensive and accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the concepts outlined in this cookbook, you are now equipped to build RAG systems capable of processing and interpreting documents with intricate visual elements. This advancement opens up new possibilities for AI applications across various domains where visual data plays a pivotal role."
