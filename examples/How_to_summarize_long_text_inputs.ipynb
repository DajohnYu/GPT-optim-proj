    "## What is tiktoken?\n",
    "\n",
    "[tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) is a fast BPE tokeniser for use with OpenAI's models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text string (e.g., \"tiktoken is great!\") and an encoding (e.g., \"cl100k_base\"), a tokenizer can split the text string into a list of tokens (e.g., [\"t\", \"ik\", \"token\", \" is\", \" great\", \"!\"]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting text strings into tokens is useful because GPT models see text in the form of tokens. Knowing how many tokens are in a text string can tell you (a) whether the string is too long for a text model to process and (b) how much an OpenAI API call costs (as usage is priced by token).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Encodings specify how text is converted into tokens. Different models use different encodings.\n",

      "The Adventure Club Afloat is an ebook written by Ralph Henry Barbour and illustrated by E.C. Caswell. It was released on October 30, 2004. The ebook is available for free use and distribution under the Project Gutenberg license. The story begins in Number 17 Sumner Hall, the oldest and most revered dormitory at Dexter Academy. The Adventure Club is formed on a warm summer evening, just before final exams are over and graduation day is approaching. The three occupants of the room are relaxed and not doing much. One of them, Perry Bush, lets out a contented yawn. The scene is set with three friends, Perry, Joe Ingersoll, and Steve Chapman, lounging in a room. Perry is sitting with his hands under his head and one foot on the floor, while Joe is sitting with his legs against the window. Steve is reclining in a chair. They can see the campus and hear fellow students singing outside. Perry is annoyed by the singing and wants to be cheerful after finishing his work. He comments on the end of the term and Steve tells him to cheer up because vacation is coming. The boys are discussing their upcoming summer vacation. Perry is unhappy because he will be alone while his friends, Steve and Joe, go to college. Perry expresses his frustration and wishes for something exciting to happen during his vacation. The boys agree that summers can be boring and that they often have more fun at school. They discuss their usual summer activities, such as going to the water gap and the seashore, but feel that nothing interesting ever happens. Perry jokingly suggests becoming a pirate, and Steve and Joe express interest in joining him. Overall, they feel that summers are not as eventful as they would like them to be. Three friends, Perry, Joe, and Steve, are bored with their current lives and express their desire for adventure and excitement. Perry wants to get away and do things, tired of his clean and white lifestyle. He suggests getting dirty and rolling in the mud. Joe is described as a fussier and more fashionable person, but still agrees that adventure sounds appealing. Perry suggests hunting big game, discovering the North Pole, or digging for hidden treasure as possible adventures. Steve suggests that they should actually go on adventures instead of just talking about it. Perry and Joe are skeptical but open to the idea. Three friends, Perry, Steve, and Joe, are tired of the mundane summer resort life and want to embark on an adventure. They discuss the possibility of finding adventures in various locations, both on land and at sea. They joke about not being able to go to Africa or the Arctic for extreme expeditions, but they believe they can still have a great time. Perry suggests that they could be as dirty as they liked during their adventures, which excites him. Joe expresses concern about his parents not allowing him to join, but Perry and Steve believe they can convince their parents. They all agree that this adventure would teach them important life lessons and provide valuable experiences. They declare their revolt against the summer resort life and embrace the idea of embarking on an adventurous journey. The speaker is considering joining a revolt but only if there is a legitimate reason for it. They discuss starting the revolt on the first day of July and debate whether to travel by land or sea. The majority votes for sea and the speaker agrees because they are looking for adventure. However, one of the participants gets seasick easily. They suggest taking a lemon to prevent seasickness, but the person claims it doesn't work. They decide to use the speaker's father's cruiser instead of a sailboat. The speaker's father is unlikely to object because he doesn't use the boat often. However, the cruiser is large and difficult to handle with just three people. The speaker's friend suggests they once sailed a knockabout and the speaker mentions having a great-grandfather who was a sea captain. Steve suggests to his friends that they gather a group of six people to go on a boat called the Cockatoo. They discuss potential people to invite, including Neil Fairleigh and Hanford. They also talk about the need for a cook and suggest Oscar Brazier. They consider having all of them join the crew and divide the labor. Perry is excited about the idea but wonders if it is just a dream. Steve assures him that it is real and they can make it happen if everyone agrees and they can find two more people. In this chapter, a group of friends discusses the possibility of going on a trip together. One of the friends, Perry, is concerned about the cost of the trip. They decide to form a club and invite more people to join, eventually settling on the name \"The Adventure Club.\" They make plans to gather more members and discuss the logistics of the trip. Perry is excited about the prospect of finally experiencing the adventures he has always longed for. A group of friends had a dream about being on a shipwreck and fighting pirates. The dream also included a cockatoo that turned into a trolleycar. The next day, the friends had a meeting to discuss a club they wanted to start. Some of the friends were unsure if they could join because their parents might not give permission. The friends discussed the idea of hiring a cook for their adventure, but some were skeptical about the cost. One friend offered to cook if he could join the adventure. The meeting ended without making a final decision. A group of friends is discussing the idea of going on a cruise. Oscar offers to be the cook, but Joe suggests hiring a regular cook. Neil and Oscar express their willingness to try cooking, but Steve says they want to keep costs low and suggests leaving the cooking to Oscar. The plan is to go on a month-long cruise, with the possibility of extending it. They decide to elect officers and realize that the boat they will be using can comfortably accommodate six people, but they could potentially fit more by using the berths in the owners cabin. They consider adding one more person to the group. Steve and Joe are discussing the idea of forming a club. Steve suggests bringing in another member, and just as he is about to explain who, a youth named Phil enters the room. They invite Phil to join their club, but he mentions that he is already committed to a convention until the sixth of the month. They offer to pick him up if they haven't left by then. Phil agrees to join. They discuss the club's officers and decide to have a captain and a treasurer. The group of boys in room number 17 are discussing the idea of electing officers for their club. Oscar objects to the idea of having a captain, but Joe suggests a different scheme of electing a president, vice president, and secretary/treasurer. They decide to write down their votes on small pieces of paper. Neil is unsure if he should vote because he is not sure if he can commit to the club. Perry reassures him that he can still join as a nonresident member. The boys then start writing down their votes. The boys in the room are Steve, George, Joe, Perry, Neil, and Phil. They describe each boy's physical appearance and some of their roles, such as Steve being the football captain and George being the senior class president. The group consists of Joe, Steve, Phil, Perry, Oscar (nicknamed Ossie), and Wink. Joe announces that Steve has been elected as number one, himself as number two, and Phil as number three. Perry expresses no disappointment and agrees that Phil is the right choice for the job. They plan to meet again that evening to discuss their cruise. During a ball game, Steve and Joe receive many applications for membership in the adventure club, but they turn most of them away. Wink, however, insists on joining despite his seasickness. Steve is being asked by his friend Wink to be included in a summer trip to California. Steve agrees to consider it but later learns that another friend, Harry, has also asked to be included. The group decides to possibly expand the membership to twelve people and split into two boats. They also suggest making the membership thirteen, despite concerns about the number being unlucky. The Adventure Club is starting with thirteen members. Ossie suggests they take a chance and join the club. They decide to invite Bert Alley, George Browne, and Casper Temple to join. They plan to go on the boat called the Cockatoo, but George Han expresses concern about the boat's capacity. Joe is sent to find Corwin, who owns the boat. By the end of the meeting, six new members have joined the club and they have added a cabin cruiser to their fleet. Two weeks later, on July 8th, Perry Bush is sitting on the deck of a motorboat near Governors Island, waiting for someone to arrive at the pier. He enjoys the smells of the ocean and nearby boats. The yacht basin is busy with sailboats and motorboats. Perry is waiting for the rest of the boat's crew to arrive. They had planned to start their adventure four days ago, but work on the cruiser delayed them. Perry and Phil have been staying with Steve, while Joe had Neil, Han, and Ossie as guests. Each crew member has added something to the boat during their wait, such as cooking supplies, a talking machine, a lifepreserver, and magazines. Joe has also stocked up on supplies. Perry is waiting at the boat for his friends to arrive. He had volunteered to load ice and water onto the boat and is now waiting for his friends to join him. He is annoyed that they are running late and considers leaving without them. However, he doesn't know how to operate the boat's engine so he decides against it. Eventually, his friends arrive, looking hot and disgruntled, carrying their belongings in parcels. Perry is satisfied with their tardiness. Perry presses a button that creates a loud noise, causing annoyance to the others on the bridge deck. Joe tells Perry to stop and help with the bundles. The group had a difficult journey to the boat, with Neil explaining that they got on the wrong car and had to walk a long distance. Perry didn't have any trouble. Han complains about the heat and asks if there is any ice water. Perry jokes about mixing ice and water. Phil Street comments on the group's negative attitude and suggests they get underway to find a breeze. Steve suggests they start their adventure on a positive note and says they have a long journey ahead. They divide into different areas of the boat and are told to put their things away neatly. The adventurers crew is preparing for service on a boat called the Adventurer, which is a forty-foot military type cruiser. The boat is painted dark green above the waterline and is freshly white below. It has a raised-deck cabin type with full headroom and a self-bailing cockpit that can accommodate seven people comfortably. The boat has a six-cylinder engine and can reach speeds of up to twenty miles per hour. The after cabin, or owner's stateroom, has two berths, a lavatory, and clothes lockers. Life preservers are strapped under the chair seats in the cockpit. The boat described is a well-appointed and capable craft. The main cabin is creamwhite with mahogany trim. The bridge deck houses the engine, steering wheel, and controls. The engine is accessible through hatches and the steering column has various controls. The main cabin has two couches that can be converted into berths at night, providing sleeping accommodations for four people. There are lockers under the seats and an extension table for meals. The galley is fitted with a large ice chest, lockers, sink with running water, and a two-burner alcohol stove with an oven. The boat also has a water tank, rope locker, and four gasoline tanks holding 250 gallons. It is lit by electricity with a generator and storage battery. There is an eight-foot tender on top of the main cabin. The boat has flagpoles at the bow and stern, and a frame abaft the bridge deck holds the union jack, yacht ensign, and club burgee. Overall, the boat is described as smart, finely appointed, and capable. It has seen little service since it was built a little over a year ago. The consensus was that Mr. Chapman was kind-hearted and taking a risk by allowing Steve and his companions to operate the cruiser without an experienced navigator. The crew members had limited experience in boating but had confidence in their ability to navigate the voyage. The boat, named the Adventurer, set sail at eleven minutes past eleven with each member of the crew in their assigned positions. Han was proud of his role as crew and planned to purchase a yachting cap with the word \"crew\" embroidered on it. Ossie and Neil were on opposite sides of the bridge, watching a cruiser with the crew on duty. The crew member named Han hitched his trousers and saluted when someone looked at him. The cruiser headed towards the narrows. Steve, who was in charge, kept his eyes on the course and used the whistle to signal different things. Perry wanted to learn navigation and stood with Steve to learn from him. Perry learned that sailing crafts have the right of way over power crafts. He also learned the whistle code and that a sailboat on the starboard tack has the right of way. Joe, who was in charge of the engine, had a book about motor boats and boating and shared information from it. In this passage, Perry is annoyed by Joe's assumption of superiority. Perry asks Joe questions about the engine to test his knowledge. Joe consults his book before answering. The engine runs smoothly and Joe is in awe of it. Steve eats his dinner on the bridge while Neil sets up a stool for him. The others eat in the main cabin. The table is adorned with a cloth and has a variety of food. Ossie apologizes for the menu. Neil asks how to open the round windows. Han says everything is fine. The group is on a boat and they are having a meal. Ossie is the steward and not the cook, but he is helping out in the galley. They are eating bread, tea, and potatoes. They finish their meal quickly because they don't want to miss anything happening outside. Ossie is enjoying himself in the galley, but they predict that he will start complaining about dishwashing soon. They see a crowded beach and buildings across the water. They discuss the possibility of running closer to the beach, but they decide to stay on their course towards Rockaway Point. Neil suggests going to Hempstead Bay, but the captain prefers going through Fire Island Inlet. The group is on a boat and passing by Coney Island. Joe tells his friends about his experiences at the amusement park and points out different attractions. Perry wishes he had peanuts. Ossie is upset that nobody told him they were passing Coney Island because he has never seen it before. The boat continues on to Rockaway and Jamaica Bay. The boat starts to rock as it passes a sandy point, causing some concern. Joe looks for his antiseasick medicine but cannot find it. The boat settles down and everyone finds a comfortable spot on the boat. There is no longer any talk of being too warm. The crew of the cabincruiser, named the Adventurer, set sail from Rockaway Beach towards Point Lookout. They encountered pleasure boats and saw three porpoises, which caused a debate among the boys about what to call them. Eventually, they compromised and called them \"porphins.\" The porpoises eventually disappeared and the crew continued their journey. They discovered that one of the porpoises had come aboard and was sleeping in the main cabin. They reached Fire Island Inlet and then sailed into the Great South Bay. They finally anchored off Bay Shore and were greeted by another group of boys on a cabincruiser named \"Follow Me.\" A group of six boys, including Wink Wheeler, Harry Corwin, Bert Alley, Caspar Temple, George Browne, and Tom Corwin, have arrived on a boat called the \"Adventurer.\" They are greeted by another boat called the \"Follow Me\" and are impressed by the size and quality of the Adventurer. The boys discuss their plans to cruise northward to Maine and decide to stay where they are until morning. A group of people are planning to go on a run from Ponquogue to Shelter Island, which is around 46 or 47 miles. They plan to start in the morning so they have plenty of time. One person, Perry, suggests taking a chance and potentially getting rescued by a lifesaving station. The group agrees to go up to the hotel for dinner before starting their journey. Han suggests going to see their boat first, and the group agrees. They decide to lock the cabins of the boat to ensure its safety. The boys then get into a tender and two dingeys and head towards the boat, which is a 34-foot craft with a hunting cabin. The cabin has four berths and a small galley. The crew consists of six members, including a person named Brownie who sleeps on a mattress on the floor. The chapter begins with a description of the boat, the Follow Me, which has a six-cylinder engine and is painted copper below the waterline and black above. The crew, consisting of six mariners, believes that the Follow Me is a comfortable and seaworthy boat. They set off to the nearest landing after taking some ginger ale and sarsaparilla from the ice chest. After exploring the town, they have dinner at a hotel and return to the boat. They gather in the cabin and cockpit, where they listen to music and talk. At 10 pm, the crew of the Follow Me leaves, and the boys on the Adventurer go to sleep. The next day, the two boats leave the harbor early in the morning. The adventurer, a flagship of the fleet, was followed by the ship \"Follow Me\" with a black hull and battleship grey deck. The bay was calm and the sunlight created beautiful shades of gold and copper on the water. The crew was polishing brightwork and joking about their tasks. Joe was becoming familiar with the engine and even dared to touch it. Ossie made a comment about overeating and glanced at Perry. The \"Follow Me\" tried to pass the adventurer, but Steve increased the throttle and the adventurer stopped going astern. Two boats, the \"Follow Me\" and the \"Adventurer,\" are racing. Harry Corwin is at the wheel of the \"Follow Me\" while his brother is in the engine room. The \"Adventurer\" starts to pull ahead and Steve, on the \"Follow Me,\" asks for more gas. The \"Follow Me\" is described as a \"puffing pig of a boat\" and the people on the \"Adventurer\" laugh at them. The engine on the \"Follow Me\" is opened up, but the \"Adventurer\" continues to gain distance. The \"Follow Me\" eventually stops and the two boats are nose to nose. The \"Follow Me\" is going at about seventeen miles an hour, while the \"Adventurer\" is going at about eighteen. The throttle on the \"Follow Me\" is opened up to the limit and the boat reaches a speed of twenty miles an hour. The \"Follow Me\" tries to keep up, but eventually falls behind and slows down. The two boats reach the Pelican Bar and the \"Adventurer\" slows down to twelve miles an hour. The \"Follow Me\" catches up and the two boats are side by side. Harry Corwin calls out to the people on the The adventurers, Steve, Perry, Han, Phil, Ossie, Neil, and Joe, are on a boat called the Adventurer. They are cruising along the shore and not seeing many other boats. Steve waves to someone on another boat and they settle down for a forty-mile run. Steve gives a navigation class to Perry and Han, while Phil writes letters and Ossie cooks in the galley. Neil rests in the cockpit and Joe reads a book on motor boating. They reach an inlet to Shinnecock Bay and follow another boat into the bay. They stop outside the canal entrance and decide to go ashore at Canoe Place. They are greeted by a small boy who offers to guide them for a quarter. The group visited an old inn where they were told that two willow trees were planted by Napoleon. They then viewed several summer estates before returning to the landing. They traveled through an artificial canal to reach a cove where they discovered that the \"Follow Me\" boat had engine trouble. The \"Adventurer\" boat offered to tow them. They arrived at North Sea Harbor and had a delayed dinner. The dinner was enjoyed by all, and Ossie was proud of his cooking. The group of boys were on a boat called the Follow Me. They came across another boat where the occupants were eating sandwiches. The boys offered to help with the engine trouble on the other boat. They were told it would be fixed in a couple of days. The boys decided to wait and have fun swimming. Eventually, the other boat was ready to go and they continued their journey. They arrived at Shelter Island and had dinner ashore. They met new people and attended a dance. They spent the next day at Shelter Island, enjoying the attractions at the hotel. Perry wanted to vote on whether or not to stay, but Neil voted against him. Perry, Neil, Steve, Joe, and Han went ashore and were seen with a group of young ladies. Perry was disgusted by this. It was Tuesday morning and the two cruisers were in New Bedford harbor. It was raining and they were discussing whether to stay in port or continue to Martha's Vineyard. Perry wanted to continue, but Steve pointed out the dangers of running the cruiser in bad weather. The group is debating whether to continue on their journey or stay in a harbor due to the heavy mist. Perry is eager for adventure and suggests going to Vineyard Haven, but the others are not as enthusiastic. They discuss visiting a museum and seeing whaling ships, but Perry dismisses the idea, claiming the ships have been sold for firewood. The conversation turns to Perry's grandmother, who is still alive and apparently smarter than Steve. Eventually, they agree to let the captain decide whether to stay or continue on. They will wait until tomorrow to make a final decision. The group decided to go ashore in New Bedford despite the drizzle. They found interesting things to do and Joe found an old whaler. They had a good dinner and spent the day playing and relaxing. They went to a moving picture show in the evening. The next morning, they set off for Edgartown. The weather was still dreary, but they had coffee, biscuits, and bacon to lift their spirits. They set sail and followed the steamboat course. There were rocks and ledges on the way, but they didn't need to worry about them. The water was rough, but they continued on. They reached Edgartown after passing through a channel. They considered staying in a good harbor until after dinner, but decided to continue on to Edgartown. The adventurers are on a boat called the Adventurer, headed towards an island in Vineyard Sound. They are concerned about a bank of grey mist that is hiding the island and worry about getting caught in it before reaching the nearest harbor, Vineyard Haven. Despite their concerns, they decide to continue on their course. However, the fog eventually catches up to them, and they realize they are in for a foggy journey. They prepare the foghorn to avoid any collisions and slow down the boat. The fog completely envelops them, making it difficult to see anything. They hear the foghorn of another boat, the Follow Me, and the rest of the crew on the Adventurer also emerge to investigate. They discuss the difficulties of steering in a fog, but the captain, Steve, remains optimistic. The foghorn continues to sound, and they hear a siren from a boat in the southeast. The boys are on a boat in foggy weather. They can't see very far and the fog settles on everything. The adventurer is not able to judge their progress and can only hear the slow throb of the engine. Joe pulls the lever of the foghorn and they hear a response from another boat. The boys realize it's a steamer but it's far away. They continue trying to make their way to Vineyard Haven, but they are unsure of their location. They hear the sound of surf but can't see anything on the chart. They continue using the foghorn at intervals and hear the distant steamer and the follow me horn. Steve suddenly looks back and realizes that the sound of the follow me horn is coming from a different direction. The group is on a boat and is experiencing confusion and uncertainty. They notice that the compass is not working properly and the foghorn from another boat sounds further away than expected. They send a distress signal but receive no response. They then hear the sound of surf nearby and realize they are in danger. They try to change direction but are unsure of their location and ultimately decide to go back the way they came. The adventurers are on a boat and are hearing the sound of surf. They are unsure if they are going towards it or away from it. They listen intently and hear the surf again, this time from dead ahead. They navigate cautiously and eventually the sound of the surf dies away. They discuss their location on the map and realize they have drifted a mile off course to starboard. They are unsure how this happened. The group of people in a boat realize they are off course and need to find their way back. They narrowly avoid hitting a breakwater. They consult a chart and determine their location. They decide to try and find the end of a jetty to enter a nearby harbor. One person is nervous about navigating in the dark. Another person suggests dropping an anchor, but they ultimately decide to continue searching for the harbor. One person plans to run along the side of the jetty to look for the harbor, and they ask the others to keep a lookout for a red spar buoy. They are determined to have dinner in the harbor. The cruiser is slowly moving forward with Steve at the wheel. Steve hears a lapping sound in the water and asks Phil if he hears it too. Neil joins Phil at the front of the boat and they continue to listen for any sounds. The engine and propeller are the only sounds they hear. Perry suddenly works the foghorn, startling everyone. Ossie suggests they eat and starts cooking potatoes. Steve asks the others if they hear anything, but they don't. Steve turns the boat slowly to starboard and they continue to listen for any sounds. Neil eventually hears the sound of surf off to starboard. Steve tells them to let him know if it gets louder. The group is on a boat entering a harbor. They hear fog signals and the sound of a cow. They anchor the boat and realize they are 18 feet from the shore. They discuss the fog and wonder where another boat called the \"Follow Me\" is. They hear bells signaling the time and realize it is noon. They plan to get dry and speculate that the \"Follow Me\" boat may be in the harbor as well. The group is on a boat in foggy weather near a harbor. They decide to stay on the boat for the day and pass the time by listening to a graphophone and playing whist. Ossie and Perry have an argument about making omelets, and the rest of the group tries both omelets and decides that Ossie's is better. They realize they need to get more eggs as there are only eight left. The group is on a yacht and the steward, Ossie, made omelets for breakfast. One of the crew members, Joe, comments that one egg is enough for breakfast, but Ossie says he needs two eggs. They discuss their hunger and Ossie complains about having to cook all the time. They have supper later and then go to bed early. The next morning, there is fog and Ossie and Perry decide to paddle ashore to buy more eggs. They agree to be back at the boat by 10:30. Perry and Han are walking along a foggy road. They are making jokes about finding their boat again and hoping the fog will clear soon. As they continue walking, the fog starts to lift and they take off their jackets. They see a strange old-fashioned horse-drawn chaise pass by and are surprised by its existence. They make a reference to a poem about a one-horse shay. They estimate they have walked about a mile and hear a cow mooing in the distance. Two people are walking in foggy weather and are trying to find a farmhouse. They eventually find a barn and locate the house, where they buy milk and eggs. They continue walking but get lost in the fog. They joke about being lost on Martha's Vineyard. They realize they have passed the lane they came up and decide to try dead reckoning to find the beach. One of them accidentally goes through poison ivy. They continue to search for the beach but are unsure which way to go. They stumble across a wall and enter a bushy area. One of them complains about getting poisoned by the ivy. The other person tries to console them, but also gets caught in a bramble. Two individuals, Han and Perry, are on a beach and Han remarks that salt water is good for bathing when one has ivy poisoning. Perry suggests using alcohol to treat the poison. They discuss finding the boat and Perry eventually finds it, but Han takes longer. Perry calls out to Han, but only receives a faint response. Perry grows impatient and eventually calls out again, but this time Han's response is unclear. Perry waits for Han, shivering in the cold mist, and listens for his footsteps but hears only the sounds of water and a creaking boom. The narrator is on a boat and is irritated with someone else on the boat. He starts to feel itchy and realizes he may have come into contact with poison ivy. He decides to row to shore to get alcohol to treat the affected areas. As he rows further away, he starts to feel guilty for leaving the other person on the boat. He also realizes that he's not sure where the boat is located. He continues rowing and periodically calls out for the other person, but receives no response. Perry is in a boat and hears a faint answer from someone. He rows towards the voice, but then hears another voice from behind him. He gets frustrated and asks where the boat is. He finally sees a black boat and a boy on it. The boy scolds Perry for almost hitting their boat and identifies himself as the person who put salt in the ocean. The boy invites Perry onto the boat, which is the battleship Pennsylvania. Perry and Cas are having a conversation. Cas accuses Perry of being stupid and asks him where the other fellows are. Perry is confused and doesn't know what Cas is talking about. Cas asks Perry where they got the boat they are in, but Perry doesn't remember. Perry recalls going ashore and finding the boat, and then asks Cas for alcohol because he got poisoned by poison ivy. Cas is hesitant but gives Perry some peroxide instead. Perry asks if Cas's friends left the boat on the beach, and Cas assumes they did. Perry and Cas are discussing the need to hurry back to a certain location. Perry is worried about finding the beach, but Cas points him in the right direction. Perry is concerned about getting lost, but Cas assures him that they had no trouble finding the harbor the previous day. Perry begins rowing a dingey and realizes that it is not meant for rowing, causing blisters on his hands and fatigue. The fog is starting to clear, but Perry is unsure if he is heading towards the beach. He becomes hot and sweaty in the sun and wishes he had something to eat. The protagonist, Perry, is rowing in search of eggs but decides to rest on his oars when he hears voices. He calls out and is answered by two middle-aged men who are apparently natives. Perry asks where the beach is and the men inform him that he is in Eastville, not the beach he was looking for. Perry realizes that he had rowed in the wrong direction due to the tide turning. He decides to row back across the harbor. The fog begins to clear and Perry finds himself in a two-mile-long harbor with several sailboats and launches. Perry is in a small hamlet called Vineyard Haven, facing a larger community called Oak Bluffs. He sees a group of dejected figures on the opposite beach, possibly marooned sailors. Perry rows towards them and is met with silence and anger from five irate youths. One of them, Harry Corwin, takes Perry's place and they head towards the Follow Me. A storm breaks out with thunder and lightning. Perry learns that the crowd had been searching for the dingey for 20 minutes and waited in the fog for 40 minutes. Perry is too tired to offer an excuse, but Cas speaks on his behalf. The others find the situation amusing and dinner is announced. In this passage, a boy named Perry is brought back to the adventurer by Harry, Tom, and Wink after being sick in the cabin. Perry explains that he went for a swim in the ocean because he was afraid of poison ivy. Han, another character, mocks Perry for not finding a boat or swimming across. Perry is then scolded by Ossie for bringing back sour milk. The next morning, the adventure club sets out on a fifty-mile run to Pleasant Bay, deciding not to go through the Cape Cod canal due to a barge blocking the way. They have fair weather and light breezes on their journey. Thirteen boys sailed to Provincetown on a yacht and arrived on a Friday afternoon. Most of them received mail, but Neil received a letter that made him upset because he had to go home. His father had to go to England, so Neil had to stay with his sick mother. Neil was disappointed because he was having a good time. He had to meet his father in New York on Sunday and would have to take a morning train. The other boys were sorry to see Neil go and offered to give him a ride to Boston. They would either wait for the rest of the group in Boston or meet them further up the shore. Neil didn't want to rush the others, but they were willing to accommodate him. Neil is traveling from Plymouth to Boston to catch a train to New York. The plan is for the Adventurer boat to leave Plymouth at 7am and the Follow Me boat to follow later. Neil and Ossie send telegrams while the others explore the town. Neil packs his belongings in laundry boxes. The next morning, the Adventurer boat sets off and the Follow Me boat signals goodbye. They reach Plymouth and spend some time exploring the town. Neil insists on seeing Plymouth Rock. They then install Neil on the train and say their farewells. The Adventurer boat loses Neil as their cabin boy. The group returned from the station and spoke about someone who had passed away. They decided to have lunch at a hotel and then went sightseeing. It was a hot day and they returned to the landing and went back to the cruiser. Steve sat on the bridge deck and read newspapers while the others found shade and talked. Joe went swimming and the others followed. The \"follow me\" boat arrived and the group swam to it. They played with one of Steve's sneakers and it sank. They had a bath and then were hungry. They had trouble finding enough food. Perry talked about a fisherman finding a shoe inside a codfish and told Steve he would read about it in the newspaper. The group, including Perry, who was forced to wear leather shoes, were not anticipating much amusement. Perry refused to buy a pair of sneakers, as it wouldn't be fair to spend money on two sneakers when he only lost one. They were invited to go to the movies by Harry Corwin, and they agreed to go. They would be waiting for them in half an hour. Perry complained about not having enough to eat, and Ossie mentioned that they would need to buy more food soon. They discussed their next stop, with Portsmouth and Salem being considered. They started the cruise to look for adventures. Perry is sad because he doesn't see many adventures coming their way. Han asks Perry if being lost in the fog was an adventure, but Perry disagrees and says real adventures involve pirates and desert islands. Joe says Perry was born too late to see pirates, and Perry argues that he would live as long as Joe if he saw a pirate. Phil suggests they go to Boston to buy supplies for their cruise, but Steve points out that they would burn a lot of gas getting there. Han mentions that part of Salem burned down, but Phil assumes it was rebuilt. They go to a movie theater but Charlie Chaplin is not playing. After wandering around the deserted streets, they give up on finding food and go back to their boat. Ossie offers to make sandwiches, and Perry comments on how hungry they all are. The adventurers had left their boat and heard shouting from another boat nearby. They couldn't understand what was being said. The adventurers realized that the smaller boat, the \"follow me,\" was missing. They concluded that it had either been taken as a joke or stolen. They decided to search for the missing boat by inquiring among the other boats in the area. They also made sure to secure their own boat and tie the other tender to it. The group is searching for a stolen motorboat that was last seen heading towards the pier head. They stop to ask a sleepy mariner for information, who confirms that he saw a dark-painted motorboat go by around half past nine. The mariner did not see the boat after it passed him. The group thanks him and continues on their search. They discuss the possible directions the thieves may have taken the boat, mentioning Provincetown, the shore, and Cape Cod Bay. They decide to consult a chart to determine the most likely route. The boat has about twelve gallons of gas and can go about seventy miles at ordinary speed. They speculate that the thieves may have to stop at Gloucester, Newburyport, or possibly even Boston Harbor. The group is discussing the possibility of painting a boat white to change its appearance. They speculate that the boat may be heading to Portland to avoid being caught. They decide to go northward and hope to find the boat. One member, Bert Alleys, disagrees and suggests that if he had stolen the boat, he would go to New York or another place to change the appearance or sell it. They discuss the limited amount of gasoline on the boat and the likelihood of needing to refuel soon. They decide that going north is the best course of action based on probabilities. They plan to communicate their situation in the morning and continue to keep a lookout. Joe is asked to work on the engine while the rest of the group keeps watch. The group of boys are on a boat called the Adventurer at night. They are using the moonlight to navigate and are keeping an eye out for any lights that could indicate another boat. They have a searchlight on the boat. Three boys are taking turns staying awake to watch for any obstacles. The rest of the boys are spread out on the boat, some on the bridge deck and some in the cockpit. The boat is traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour. At one point, they see a light that turns out to be a coasting schooner. Around one o'clock, they see something ahead that looks like a boat or a rock. One of the boys confirms that it is a boat and they continue on their course. The group of boys is on a boat, watching another boat in the distance. They believe that the boat they are watching is the \"follow me.\" The boys try to use a searchlight to get a better look at the boat, but it is too far away. The moon disappears, leaving them in darkness. They continue to follow the boat towards the harbor. They discuss the distance to the harbor and the possibility of the boat trying to evade them. They notice that the boat they are following has turned on its lights, possibly because they are afraid of being caught. They are becoming more convinced that this is indeed the \"follow me.\" They wonder if the boat knows that they are following it. The group is searching for someone and believes they have found her. They plan to anchor near the breakwater and keep watch until daylight. They believe the person they are looking for is low on fuel and will not be able to escape. They turn off all the lights on deck to remain hidden. The binnacle on the boat went out, leaving the boat in darkness near a red flash from a lighthouse. The adventurer drew closer to a white beacon and dropped anchor. Steve reported that they were all secure. In the darkness, a town clock struck two. Steve and Bert Alley stayed on deck while the others napped. As the sky began to lighten, they noticed a dark boat a few hundred yards away. It turned out to be a black-hulled powerboat used for gillnetting. The others joined them on deck as the light increased. The adventurer was anchored far from the inner harbor, with only a rusty-red salt bark and five fishing schooners in sight. Steve speculated that the boat they were looking for may be in the inner harbor and suggested they go investigate. The boys are planning to have an early breakfast. Bert Alley is tired and drags his feet. They sail up the harbor looking for the boat they are searching for. They search various piers and coves. They receive false clues from sailors on fishing schooners. They eventually give up and acknowledge defeat. They discuss the possibility of the boat getting gasoline in the area. They spot another powerboat, but it is not the one they are looking for. Steve discovers a way out through a drawbridge that leads to the Squam River. Steve and his companions are traveling on a cruiser called the Adventurer. They are heading towards Ipswich Bay to find the Follow Me. As they approach a drawbridge, they notice a narrow space between the bridge masonry with a strong current. Despite their concerns about headroom, they decide to continue through the narrow space. They successfully pass through the bridge and enter a narrow canal that leads to the river. They navigate carefully, as the depth is only four feet at low tide. Along the way, they enjoy the beautiful scenery and stop to examine motorboats in different coves. They discuss the possibility of the Follow Me anchoring and waiting for daylight to navigate the area. They also keep an eye out for gasoline stations along the way. They eventually find a gasoline station at Annisquam near a yacht club pier. The protagonist, Steve, and his friends are looking for a motorboat called the \"Follow Me.\" They come across a grizzled man who says he saw a boat matching that description about two hours ago. The boat had no name on it, but the man sold them gas and they headed towards the bar. The man believes they may have painted over the boat's name. Steve asks who was on the boat, and the man says there were three men he had never seen before. The men woke him up from breakfast and seemed in a hurry. Steve realizes that the boat has been stolen. The man suggests they may have taken the boat to the Essex River, Ipswich, or Newburyport, or hidden it behind Plum Island. They decide to search Plum Island and Steve points out its location on the chart. They agree to check it out, as well as other potential locations. They head southeast across Squam Bar. The narrator and his companions are sailing south and looking for a black spar buoy off a lighthouse. They are in Essex Bay and are not seeing any sign of the boat they are looking for, called the \"follow me.\" They pass by sand dunes and a snow-white beach as they make their way towards Plum Island Sound. They see other boats but none of them are the \"follow me.\" The sun is hot and they navigate carefully through the Ipswich River. They discuss what to do if there are no soundings shown on the chart. They have been following the \"follow me\" for twelve hours and it seems like they will continue to do so for a while longer. The narrator mentions that they should have reported the lost boat to the police, as their father will be upset if they don't find it. The narrator's friend, Wink, doubts they will find the boat and suggests it could be in New York. However, the narrator claims to see the boat ahead and pushes back the throttle. The chapter ends with the mention of a black cruiser that is anchored a half-mile away. Harry Corwin spots a boat at the mouth of a cove and recognizes it as the one they have been searching for. The group discusses their plan to retrieve the boat, considering the possibility of the men on the boat having guns. They decide to approach the men and ask them to hand over the boat, but are prepared to take it by force if necessary. They also consider the option of some members of the group landing and approaching the men from behind. They discuss what to do with the men if they catch them, and anticipate that the men may try to escape in a smaller boat. They realize that the boat they are trying to retrieve can sail around their boat easily. The group decides to take action and prepares their weapons. The group of people on the boat called the Adventurer are trying to figure out if another boat, the Follow Me, can go the other way to get out of a certain place. They determine that the Follow Me can go in the opposite direction for about five miles, but there is a bridge that prevents it from getting out. The group decides to ask for the Follow Me boat and try to bluff their way into getting it. They approach the Follow Me and ask for the boat, but the men on the Follow Me claim that the boat belongs to them. The group insists that the boat belongs to them and that the Follow Me has painted over its name. A man and his companion are on a boat called the Esmeralda of Providence. Another group of twelve men have followed them from Plymouth and are demanding that they hand over the boat. The man on the Esmeralda refuses and a standoff ensues. One of the men on the other boat reveals a gun, causing the men on the Esmeralda to take cover. The man on the Esmeralda warns the other group that they will be followed and handed over to the authorities if they try to escape. A group of men on a stolen boat are being pursued by another boat. The men on the stolen boat discuss their options and decide to return the boat to Gloucester and hand it over. However, one man refuses and tries to pull up the anchor. Another man on the pursuing boat warns him not to touch the cable or they will shoot. The man ignores the warning and is shot at, causing him to retreat. One of the men on the stolen boat also fires a shot from the cabin. The pursuing boat changes direction and the man on the stolen boat is told to come up to the hatch. A group of people on a boat are being shot at by pirates on another boat. The group tries to shoot back, but the pirates are shooting accurately and causing damage to the boat. The group discusses their options and decides to try to keep the pirates from running away until they surrender. They are hesitant to let the pirates escape because they might use tricks to get away. The pirates continue to shoot at the group, but they manage to shoot back and damage the pirates' boat as well. In this chapter, the boys are on a boat called the \"follow me\" when they hear a pistol shot and realize Perry has been shot in the arm. Steve tells the other boys to get out of the way while he tends to the wound. Wink takes a shot at the person who shot Perry and hits him. Steve also fires back at the attacker. The boys continue to increase the distance between their boat and the attacker's boat to avoid getting shot again. The group of people on the deck of a ship are being attacked by someone or something. They are trying to defend themselves and are armed with revolvers. One of them, Steve, is injured but not seriously. They are waiting for the attackers to show themselves. They mention having a refrigerator and other items between them and the bullets. One of them, Ossie, is preparing dinner. They discuss the possibility of running out of ammunition and wish they had a rifle. The smell of coffee from the galley is comforting. Perry, who has a bandaged arm, asks Steve for a chance to shoot at the attackers. Suddenly, the ship starts moving. Joe remarks that they are anchored, indicating confusion or surprise. The protagonist, Steve, realizes that their boat's communication line has been cut and suspects that the thieves may have reached through a port on the other side. The adventurers quickly maneuver their boat, the Adventurer, to avoid being detected. Steve notices that the other boat, the Follow Me, is steering without anyone in the cockpit. He learns that there is an auxiliary wheel in the stateroom of the Follow Me. The adventurers take cover as the Follow Me opens fire on them, but the shots miss due to the Adventurer's fast movements. The chase begins as both boats speed up. Harry is given Steve's revolver and stands on the dining table to keep watch. The Adventurer slowly closes the distance between them and the Follow Me. Wink admires the speed of the Adventurer. The others return to the bridge to watch the progress. Tom is angry and wants to shoot at the Follow Me. The adventurers are in boats and trying to catch up to the \"follow me\" boat. They notice that the \"follow me\" boat is hindered by a tender, which is slowing it down. The adventurers decide to take a risky move by attempting to follow the \"follow me\" boat through a shallow channel. The channel is close to the shore and has varying depths. The \"follow me\" boat successfully navigates through the channel, but the adventurers encounter some trouble when their boat gets stuck in the sand. However, they manage to free themselves and continue pursuing the \"follow me\" boat. Steve and Joe are on a boat chasing after a boat called the Follow Me. The Follow Me is trying to avoid them by staying close to shore and near sunken rocks called Emerson Rocks. The adventurer boat, driven by Steve, comes close to the submerged rocks but manages to avoid them. The chase continues and the distance between the two boats shortens. The crew on the adventurer boat is focused on catching the Follow Me and not paying attention to dinner preparations. Harry Corwin is summoned to help with the chase. The boats are expected to be on even terms soon. In this chapter, the protagonist, Steve, and his companions are on a boat called the Adventurer. They notice a black cruiser in the distance and decide to approach it. Harry and Wink discuss the possibility of the cruiser having artillery, but Steve reassures them that they only have two pieces. As they get closer, they notice a seagull and Harry prepares to watch the gun on the cruiser. Steve goes below deck and notices the change in boat positions. He thinks about shooting through the door but decides against it. Brownie expresses concern about being shot at and goes to sit on the floor. Steve warns everyone to leave if bullets start flying. The Adventurer slowly approaches the stern of the cruiser and the crew realizes that the cruiser is going to run ashore. They watch as it rushes towards the shore, creating a mess. Harry believes they will never get the cruiser off the shore. As the cruiser nears the shore, three men jump out and run along the roof. Wink raises his revolver, but Steve tells him to let them go. The Adventurer falters but continues towards the shore. The protagonist and two others are on a boat called the adventurer. They encounter a breaking wave and are forced to scuttle to land. They run up the beach to the north. Steve, one of the characters, gives orders to get a big cable from the rope locker. Joe and Harry jump into a tender and attach the cable to the follow me, another boat. Tom goes below to the engine, and Harry secures their end of the line. The adventurer starts to reverse with the help of the follow me's propeller. After a couple of minutes, the adventurer is freed and returns to an even keel. The two boats continued up the shore, one boat losing an anchor and gaining a stolen dingey. They had dinner and discussed their adventure. The stolen boat was damaged but fixable, and the stolen boat's larder was depleted. They decided to leave the stolen boat at Newburyport and advertise it in the Plymouth papers. The other boat also had some damage but they were able to recover it. They found a yard in Newburyport to repair the boats and acquired a new anchor. They set out again in the early morning and passed the Isles of Shoals and Boon Island. The crew of the Adventure Club goes on a cruise off Cape Porpoise. They encounter rough seas and some members of the crew, including Joe, suffer from seasickness. The weather eventually improves and they continue their cruise, stopping at Portland and Casco Bay. They spend a week enjoying themselves without any real adventures. During their time on the boat, Joe fell in love with many islands and expressed his desire to own one. Steve humored him at first, but eventually grew tired of constantly stopping at different islands. The group realized that Joe would not be able to afford an island, so they continued sailing along the Maine coast. They eventually stopped at Camden, where they enjoyed home-cooked meals and had a good time. Ossie, the cook, was happy to have a break from cooking bacon. However, the rest of the group secretly agreed that it was a good thing they were eating ashore, as Ossie's cooking had been declining in quality. They joked about the possibility of the crew taking over the cooking duties, but agreed that it would not be ideal. They also mentioned a failed pudding that Ossie had made using onion extract instead of vanilla. The mention of the pudding still caused amusement among the group. The boys experienced pain and humiliation. They went swimming every morning and spent a lot of time outdoors. They wore khaki trousers, sleeveless shirts, and canvas shoes. They had breakfast on the boats and often mingled with the other crew. They made friends and spent more time on shore than on the boat. They played tennis and went on car rides with a youth named Globbins. They had a good time in Camden and promised to stop there again. On a return voyage, the two boats decided to explore a tiny bay they stumbled upon. The bay had a round pool of blue water surrounded by cliffs, trees, and boulders. They enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the decks of the boats and spent the day relaxing in the sunshine. They also went fishing and caught enough for supper. The idea to stay overnight in the pool was suggested and everyone agreed. They later explored the island but couldn't find any paths or learn much about it. The group of friends named the island \"Mystery Island\" and the little harbor \"Titanias Mirror\". Bert Alley suggested the name, which was initially met with jibes but eventually agreed upon. Steve defended Bert's suggestion, saying it was a fine name for the prettiest bit of water they had ever seen. However, Steve was criticized for being afraid of being seen as poetical or imaginative. Twilight came early and the water of Titanias Mirror took on strange and beautiful hues. Cas Temple and Bert Alley played mandolins, but the island was populated by mosquitoes. The next morning, half of the group went for a race to the entrance of the channel in Titanias Mirror. They enjoyed the idyllic surroundings until tragedy seemed to be close. In the next chapter, the burglars are introduced. Wink Wheeler reached the channel first and climbed onto a ledge, while Joe and Phil continued swimming. The others focused on diving from a rock and racing around the anchored boats. Brownie was the only one who didn't accept the challenge. Brownie and his friends were lined up on a boulder, preparing for a race. Three of them jumped into the water and started swimming. Brownie watched as they swam towards the mouth of a harbor. Suddenly, Joe stopped swimming and Phil turned back to help him. Brownie, realizing that Joe was in trouble, jumped into the water and started swimming towards them. Brownie tried to conserve his strength as he swam towards Joe and Phil, navigating through the waves. He was unsure if he was making any progress. The passage describes a person named Brownie who is struggling to swim back to shore. He is being carried back by the waves and is starting to panic. He turns on his back to catch his breath and sees his friend Phil swimming towards him to help. Phil is able to support Brownie and they continue swimming towards shore. Brownie is exhausted but Phil assures him they will make it. When they are close to shore, other people come to help them and ask what happened. Brownie explains that he had a cramp in his legs. The narrator and his friends are on a boat trip. One of their friends, Joe, falls overboard and they rush to rescue him. It is a difficult task, but they manage to get Joe and another friend, Brownie, back on board. They give them hot coffee, blankets, and medicine to help them recover. The next morning, everyone is feeling better and they have a late breakfast. During breakfast, Steve tells everyone that they should not swim away from the boats anymore because the water is colder than they are used to and it could be dangerous. Phil admits that it was foolish to swim so far out and thought Joe was going to drown. Phil believes that Brownie deserves recognition for jumping in and rescuing Joe. Phil does not consider himself a hero because he is comfortable in the water. The group of friends, including Steve, Phil, and Joe, were swimming near a boat when Joe got scared and almost drowned. Brownie is considered the hero for saving Joe. Ossie explains that they didn't know about the incident until someone saw them struggling and alerted the others. Steve and Wink thought Joe was having a fit until they were informed of the situation. Joe later reappeared, feeling better after being sick. Perry teases Joe for always getting into trouble. Joe thanks Brownie for saving him, but Mr. Carnegie is still unaware of the incident. The group leaves Titanias Mirror and Mystery Island and tries to locate it on the charts but fails. The island was smaller than they originally thought. Ossie suggests that Mystery Island may be the top of an underwater rock. The group of friends is on a boat near an extinct volcano. They speculate that the volcano sank and the sea flowed into the crater. They climbed on a rock that they believe is volcanic. They then have engine trouble and anchor in Frenchmans Bay. They go ashore, explore the town, and have an expensive dinner. On their way back, they see a lawn party and decide to crash it. Some of the friends are skeptical, but one suggests sending a message to the hostess. They ultimately decide to go without an invitation, hoping for food and pretty lanterns. A group of friends decide to crash a party. Some of them are hesitant, but they are convinced to go along with it. They arrive at a large residence and are not challenged by anyone. There is a dance floor set up and a hundred guests are already there. The boys approach the terrace where the hostess is receiving guests. One of the boys, Perry, confidently greets the hostess and engages in casual conversation with her. Another boy, Wink, follows suit. The rest of the group hesitates but eventually joins them on the terrace. Perry and his friends attend a party. They witness the embarrassment of the other boys and laugh about it. Perry suggests exploring the big tent but they are told that dinner is at ten o'clock. They then try to find something else to do but end up getting separated from their companions. Perry and Wink comment on the mixed crowd at the party. Perry and Ossie are exploring a walled space that overlooks the water. They are impressed by the view and the scent of the sea and roses. They discuss the idea of living on a real island. They then come across a large library with many books. Perry admires the collection and wonders if anyone has read them all. They discuss their hunger and the upcoming meal. They decide to enter the house through a window and explore further, despite Ossie's hesitation. They find the library to be a large and impressive room. In a dimly lit room with long windows opening onto a terrace, there are somber and elegant furnishings. The room is filled with mahogany furniture and shelves of books. As two individuals make their way towards the far end of the room, they are startled by a sudden sound. A middle-aged man in evening attire enters the room through one of the windows and closes it behind him. He crosses the room and stops by a fireplace, where he reveals a small safe hidden behind a panel. Perry, one of the individuals in the room, realizes that he is witnessing a robbery. Perry quickly crosses the room and pins the robber down to the floor with the help of his companions, Wink and Ossie. The man on the rug is thrashing about and shouting for help. Perry sternly commands everyone to be quiet and sit on the man's legs. Perry is holding the man's arms to the floor and threatens to punch him if he makes a noise. Perry asks the man what he was doing at the safe. The man is silent for a moment and then glares at them in amazement. Perry asks what the game is, and the man calls them young ruffians. Wink warns the man to answer politely or else he will be hurt. The man asks to be let up and suggests they have a more comfortable conversation. Perry agrees as long as the man promises not to run. The man dusts off his clothes and asks why they attacked him. Perry asks what the man was doing at the safe, and the man questions if it's any of their business. Perry accuses the man of being a cracksman, but the man insists the house and safe are his and his name is Drummond. Perry and his friends are confronted by a man named Mr. Drummond, who accuses them of trying to rob his safe. Perry denies the accusation, saying they saw him come in and thought it was strange. Mr. Drummond becomes suspicious of their presence and questions them further. Perry and his friends quickly flee from the room and Mr. Drummond chases after them, commanding someone named Wilkins to catch them. Three boys, Perry, Wink, and Ossie, were being pursued by robbers. They ran through a service yard and into a tangle of shrubbery and trees. As they ran, they heard cries of \"stop thief\" and the sound of footsteps. Perry led the way, followed by Wink and Ossie. They eventually reached a wall and decided they needed to climb over it. Perry helped Wink up first, then Ossie. They caught their breath for a moment before continuing their escape. They broke through a coldframe and ran towards a house with lights and people on the porch. They turned right and continued running along a lawn. Three boys were walking when a car passed them. One of the boys, Perry, chased after the car and the other two, Ossie and Wink, followed. They eventually huddled on the gas tank at the back of the car and held on as it drove away. Ossie expressed concern about going the wrong way and potentially getting killed. They waited for the car to slow down, but it only went faster, passing houses and stores. Eventually, the car braked suddenly, causing the boys to fall off. They were bruised and dizzy but eventually got up and walked back in the direction they came from. They walked in silence until Wink started laughing uncontrollably. The other boys joined in and they laughed hysterically in the middle of the road. Over an hour later, they reached their destination and found that the tenders were gone but there was still a light on the boat. Three boys, Perry, Wink, and Ossie, are out on a boat. They call out to someone named Han, who is in a dingey, and ask where he has been. Perry explains that they got tired of waiting and went for a ride. Han asks if they got any food, and Perry says they did not. Han then tells them about a party they missed where they chased burglars. Perry and Wink are surprised and ask when this happened. Han explains it was around a quarter to ten while they were dancing. Perry says they did hear something but didn't think much of it. Wink is upset that they were not invited to the party, but Han insists they were. Wink says that the hosts were probably more upset to see them leave than to see Perry, Wink, and Ossie there. The chapter ends with Wink stumbling into the cockpit. The group went ashore again and were unable to convince Perry and Ossie to leave the boats. Perry and Ossie were fed up with Bar Harbor and hinted that they were ready to continue the voyage without protest. Han brought back a newspaper article about an attempted robbery at a cottage, which the group read with interest. Perry, Ossie, and Wink seemed to enjoy the seclusion of the cabins. The cruisers left the harbor the next day and passed Petit Manan Island, which had a tall lighthouse. The group discussed the harsh winter conditions on the islands and the lack of amenities. They also mentioned a mission boat called the Sunbeam that helped the people living on these islands. The islands were in bad shape with no schools or churches, and the people were struggling with loneliness and a lack of ambition. There is a man named Alexander MacDonald who started a mission and now lives on a boat called the Sunbeam. He travels along the coast, teaching people how to live clean and take care of themselves. He also brings them books and starts schools. MacDonald is well-respected and always welcomed by the people on the islands he visits. Some people think it would be exciting to go on a trip with him and experience his many adventures. The group of boys passed by several islands during their journey. They stopped at one small islet where they encountered sad and rundown inhabitants. They bought lobsters and blueberries from the locals before continuing their journey. They experienced good weather until they encountered a storm near Grand Manan and had to take shelter in a tiny harbor for two days. During this time, there were minor incidents such as Han falling overboard and Ossie cutting his finger while opening a lobster. There was also a disagreement between Ossie and Perry over biscuits, but it was resolved before it escalated into a fight. They spent two days at Grand Manan before continuing their journey. The protagonist is excited to discover that Grand Manan is a part of New Brunswick. He declares it as his first time setting foot on a foreign shore. They stay in Eastport for four days because the engine of their boat needs to be fixed. They receive a letter from Neil, who is down on his luck and asks for news of the club. Perry plans to start a sardine industry on the banks of the Delaware River when they return home. He learns that sardines can be any type of fish as long as it is young enough. He suggests using minnows or young shad for their venture. The conversation is about making sardines and the process involved. Ossie thinks it is easy to make sardines by pouring oil in a tin can and drowning the fish in it. But there is a little more to it, including boiling the fish. Ossie suggests going to see how they make sardines at a place where they build them. However, Perry does not want to go because he already got a whiff of the smell. \n",
      "Later, the adventurers turn back into home waters and encounter some clouds. Joe suggests running for shelter, but the others dismiss the suggestion because there is no wind and the barometer says fair. The barometer is considered a joke on the boat as nobody can read it properly. Steve has given up on it, but Joe still believes in its weather forecasting abilities. The speaker is on a boat and they are discussing the weather. They mention that it might snow before night and they don't understand why they need to go into the harbor if there is no sign of fog. They mention that if it's just rain, they have been wet before and they should continue sailing. The speaker asks someone to find the next chart. They notice the seal islands off to the port and the boat they are following is behind them. Suddenly, a gust of wind comes from the north and sets the canvas and flags rattling. The sky darkens and spray starts coming over the rail. They lose sight of the boat they were following. The speaker comments on the mess and wishes they were further along. The storm continues to worsen and the boat is tossing about. They have to hold on tight to whatever is nearest to them. Steve and Joe are on a boat in rough seas. The boat is being hit by waves, and the deck is getting flooded. Steve decides that it would be dangerous to try and reach a nearby haven. Instead, they decide to run straight down the shore. Joe assures Steve that their boat, the Follow Me, is capable of handling tough weather. However, it starts raining heavily, making it difficult to see. Steve is unsure of their location and decides to trust luck and run for it. Joe jokingly says that they are likely to run over an island if they come across one. Suddenly, Steve spots a towering cliff ahead and tries to steer away, but the boat still hits it. In Chapter XIX, the boys find themselves shipwrecked after their cruiser hits the sand in the surf. The boat rocks and thumps as the waves crash over it. Despite the chaos, the boys remain calm and follow Steve's orders. Steve shuts off the engine and secures the chartbox. They all put on life preservers and cling to whatever they can find. Steve ties a rope to the cleat on the cabin roof and urges the others to prepare to swim to the beach. Joe offers to go first, but Steve insists that he will go ahead. He removes his coat and shoes and wraps the rope around his waist. He tells the others to remove their coats and shoes as well and to make sure the hatch is shut tight. The group of people on the ship were trying to make their way to the bow. Joe was the first to reach the bow and waited for the rope to tighten before signaling to the others. One by one, they all made it to the bow safely, except for Han who slipped but managed to catch onto something. Phil was the last to go and saw Ossie swimming in the water before he disappeared. Phil struggled to hold onto the rope as he battled the waves, but eventually made it to shore with the help of Joe and Han. They found themselves on a narrow ledge of sand and shingle under a large cliff. Six boys are stranded on a beach during a storm. They are concerned about their boat, the Adventurer, which is anchored offshore and being battered by waves. Steve, one of the boys, fastens a cable to a boulder on the shore to help stabilize the boat. He decides to swim back to the boat to check on it and asks the others to wait for him. Perry volunteers to search for a way up the cliff from the beach. Steve successfully reaches the boat and returns to the shore with news that it may hold if the storm subsides, but there is water in the cabin. Perry confirms that they can find a way up the cliff. The group of people find a shelf about 100 feet away from them. They struggle to reach it but eventually do. The shelf is barely big enough for all of them and is sloped at a steep angle. They huddle together for warmth and try to start a fire but are unsuccessful. They have a miserable night, with everyone getting wet and cold. One person, Ossie, complains of chest pains but it is later determined to be stomach pains. The storm starts to lighten in the morning, but the wind is still strong and the waves are still pounding. They notice that their boat, the adventurer, has shifted and the waves are hitting it directly. The group of people are stranded on a boat that is in poor condition. They are hungry and cold. They discuss the difficulty of getting the boat off the sand and express pessimism about their situation. They decide to eat breakfast, consisting of crackers and rainwater. They then make their way to the beach, but their vision is limited due to heavy mist. They estimate they are about two miles from the mainland and are worried about their fate. The group of people, who were stranded on an island, realized that no other boats had followed them, suggesting that they were probably safe. They decided to split up into two parties to explore the island and agreed to meet back in an hour. They discovered that the island was small and surrounded by water. They climbed to the top of the island and saw the form of their boat in the distance. They were unsure of their location and how to get back. They jokingly mentioned the lack of a hotel on the island and made their way back to their camp, gathering firewood along the way. Steve and his friends are stranded on a ledge and need to start a fire. They try using wet twigs from the fir trees, but they don't burn. Steve suggests they do what Robinson Crusoe would do and go get kindling from a wrecked ship. Joe disagrees and says they should go get gasoline from their boat, the Adventurer. They decide to use vinegar as a substitute for gasoline and Steve goes to get it while Joe goes with him. They successfully start a fire and bring back food and utensils to cook breakfast. The shipwrecked mariners, Phil and Perry, have finished their watch and are enjoying bacon and coffee. They wait for the tide to recede so they can assess the damage to their ship, the adventurer. The ship's planks are strained but intact, and the propeller is undamaged. However, the forward cabin and enginewell are flooded. The boys discuss the possibility of plugging the ship's seams and using a pump to get to port. However, they realize that the ship is stuck in the sand and the propeller is buried. Steve suggests finding something to fix a line to astern in order to pull the ship off with the windlass. He spots a rock in the distance and thinks it may be useful. Last night, Joe grazed something and cried for a rope. Steve agreed to help and they replaced the bow line with a smaller rope and took it through the breakers to a ledge. Steve managed to get a big cable around the rock and they returned to the boat. Meanwhile, the others were caulking the seams with strips of muslin. They led the cable through a ring at the stern and carried it forward to the windlass. By the time the tide started to rise again, they had gotten the hull free of water. They waited to see how well their caulking had worked and ate cold rations during noon. The rain stopped, the clouds started to break, and the wind became less fierce. They set the boat in order and waited for high tide again. The water slowly filled the bilge, but the pump was able to handle it. They went ashore and built a fire. Around four, the wind died down and the sun came out. The mist disappeared and they exclaimed in joy. Six people on a boat are excited to see the mainland in the distance. They try to determine their location but are unsure. They decide to wait for evening and high tide before attempting to leave the island. They have dinner and at half past eight, they start trying to move the boat using the engine and windlass. They encounter some difficulties but remain hopeful. The bow of a boat needed to be lightened in order for it to move. Ossie and Han worked on the lever and eventually the boat started moving inch by inch. They had to cut the rope to free the boat from a rock and then headed towards a lighthouse. They had to use a pump to fix a leak in the boat. They eventually anchored in a harbor for the night and then moved further down the coast to get repairs for the boat. Most of the damage was not severe, but repairs would take a week. Most of the crew went to Camden by rail while Steve and Phil stayed behind to supervise the repairs. The Follow Me was located and was sailing for Camden the next day. The narrator and another person arrived at a marine railway in the morning but were not certain if they were at the right place. The captain and first mate of a boat lived on board and had a pleasant time for six days. They received letters from their friends in Camden and noticed that the boat had been refurbished. On a Friday afternoon, they anchored alongside another boat called the Follow Me, which was deserted. They met up with their friends at a hotel and were warmly greeted, especially by someone named Perry who refused to leave the narrator's side. Perry asked to borrow money from the narrator because he was broke. The narrator gave him five dollars and asked for it back soon because they were also low on funds. The narrator mentioned that money doesn't last long in that place. Their friends and acquaintances from their previous visit had made their stay very pleasant. The group of friends, including Steve and Phil, were discussing the idea of going on a trip. Steve was open to the idea and wanted to enjoy himself. They received a letter from their friend Neil, who was having a dull time, and they decided to write him a cheerful reply. They experienced delays due to a storm, but eventually set off for Squirrel Island. They didn't have a particular interest in visiting the island, but they had time to spare. While at sea, Steve and Phil noticed an object in the distance and were puzzled by it. The narrator and Phil are on a boat when they spot a wreck in the distance. They use binoculars to get a closer look and believe that no one is on board. They discuss the possibility of claiming the wreck as their own, but Steve is unsure if they can actually get it. They decide to continue on their way, acknowledging the value of the lumber on the wreck. The schooner, named Catspaw, is described as not being very big but has a lot of lumber on board. The group decides to tow the schooner and Steve suggests they try it if the weather permits. The project is communicated to those aboard the Follow Me boat. They approach the derelict and assess its condition. The schooner is about eighty feet long, with a beam of approximately twenty-two feet and a displacement of around a hundred tons. It is square-sterned and bluntnosed, indicating it was built for capacity rather than speed. The name Catspaw and its home port, Norfolk, are visible on the bow. The cargo on board consists of rough pine boards, occupying every available space on deck. The deckhouse is obscured, and the mainmast is dragging behind the starboard beam, acting as a seaanchor. The deck is cleared except for a splintered gaff wedged in the boards. The hull is black and has a dingy white streak along the side. The adventurers cautiously approach the leeward side of the schooner and prepare to board it. The group of boys climbed aboard a schooner in rough seas. They found the ship to be deserted and lacking any valuable items. The boys determined that the ship could still float due to its load of lumber. They decided to try and tow the ship to Portsmouth, about 30 miles away. They worked for two hours to prepare the ship for towing, including rigging a jurymast and securing anchor cables. A prize crew consisting of five boys was placed in charge of the ship. They stocked the galley with food and found wood for the stove. However, there was some water on board that bothered the cook. The group of sailors found some old rubber boots and had dinner on their respective cruisers. They left one tender with the schooner in case of emergency. They discussed the value of a dingey in case the schooner sank. Joe and Wink were assigned to take turns at the wheel, Perry and Han were assigned to tend to the sail and keep a lookout, and Bert was assigned to cook. The group used a code of signals for communication. The sailors cheered as they pulled away in the dingey, and the schooner reluctantly started to follow the cruisers. Han and Perry waved caps triumphantly and Joe shouted back from the wheel. The three-cornered sail was adjusted to catch the following breeze. The boat, called the Catspaw, was moving slowly at about three miles per hour. Perry, protected by a slicker, sat on the windlass and waved to people on passing cruisers. Joe, who had been steering the boat, found it tiring and passed the task to Wink. The Catspaw was heading west-southwest towards Kittery Point and expected to arrive at Portsmouth Harbor by 2 o'clock in the morning. The crew of the Catspaw was excited about the adventure and not worried about potential dangers. Perry expressed his delight in finding a thrilling adventure, unlike their recent shipwreck. However, Wink preferred adventures on top of the water rather than beneath it. Joe reassured everyone that the boat couldn't sink because of all the lumber on it, but Bert suggested that it could still get waterlogged. A group of individuals are on a lumber schooner called the Catspaw. They are concerned about the possibility of a storm causing the ship to capsize due to the large amount of lumber piled on deck. One of the individuals wishes they had a barometer to predict the weather. Another individual sarcastically remarks that they would only know what the first person tells them to expect. They discuss the items that were taken off the ship before the storm, including the barometer. They spot a tugboat approaching them and wonder if the captain of the tugboat wants to hire them for a job. They hope that their friend Steve, who is in charge of the Catspaw, doesn't agree to the job because they believe they can handle it themselves. The tugboat eventually leaves without hiring them. The individuals on the Catspaw feel a bit lonely after the tugboat leaves and wonder if they made the right decision in not accepting the job. The adventurers are on a boat in the dark. They have placed lanterns on the boat and on the deckhouse for visibility. They eat supper and prepare for bad weather. A squall of wind and rain hits them, making it difficult to navigate. They struggle to keep the boat steady and the waves crash against the boat. The cruisers are having difficulty as well. The adventurers anticipate that the cruisers will signal to cast off the hawsers soon. The group is stranded on a schooner in bad weather. They discuss the possibility of anchoring or drifting. They decide to stay on the schooner and wait for the wind to die down. They watch another boat, the Adventurer, for a signal. Finally, they cast off the cables and wait for further instructions. Some of them go to sleep while others stay awake. The protagonist, Perry, wakes up the rest of the crew on a boat during a gale. They struggle to keep their balance and make their way to the galley. Bert starts a fire while the others go to the wheel. Wink greets them but sounds tired. Han takes down the sail and Perry notices that the other boat is missing. They encounter big waves and Wink jokes about taking a nap. Joe suggests they have coffee before turning in. Perry goes forward and sees that the boats are missing. Han suggests the boats are having a rough time. Perry settles in and looks for the light at the stern or the other boat, but only hears the wind and the groaning of the boat. He fights sleep and regrets suggesting to rescue the catspaw. The narrator is on lookout duty on a schooner during a stormy night. They try not to think about what would happen if they give up, but it is a miserable three hours. Another person, Bert, briefly joins them but then seeks shelter. The sky eventually lightens, but the surroundings are still bleak. There is a cruiser to the north but the other is not visible. The waves are high and there is no land in sight. They estimate they are about forty miles at sea. They see a brig to the south for a short time. The boys have a meager breakfast and express concern about the gale continuing. The adventurer, a white cruiser, comes closer and exchanges signals. The follow me appears later and at noon, the schooner and two convoys are reunited. However, they still cannot get lines aboard. The spirits of the prize crew are low as the afternoon begins. The narrator and their companions spent another night on the schooner. They saw two other boats, a steamer and a schooner, but neither showed any interest in them. The narrator tried to communicate with the steamer using a megaphone, but it was unsuccessful. The wind started to calm down and they were able to put up their sail again. They headed towards the coast. As darkness fell, they were able to get the cables aboard the schooner with the help of a tender boat. The tender boat brought them food as well. There was little time for conversation before it got dark. The speaker, Steve, is describing a difficult night on a boat where they almost capsized multiple times. They lost sight of another boat's lights and thought it had sunk. The crew ate supper and became cheerful as the weather improved. The second night was easy and the weather cleared. They reached the shore and were taken to a wharf where they were interviewed by a reporter. After eating, they went to an address they had secured on the wharf. Steve and his friends have returned from their salvage mission and are waiting on the porch of a hotel. They have decided that they won't accept less than a thousand dollars for their salvage. Mr. Anthony T. Hyatt, their attorney, is described as having a large round face with three chins. He is surprised to hear that they have the salvage tied up at Sawyer's Wharf. Steve tells him the story of how they found the salvage and brought it in themselves. They want to know what claim they have against the owners. Mr. Hyatt initially jokes about them not having a claim, but then reassures them that they do have a strong claim. The speaker, Steve, is seeking advice from a lawyer regarding a claim against the owners or insurance company of a ship called the \"catspaw.\" The ship and its cargo were likely insured, but the amount of compensation is not specified by law and must be negotiated between the salvors (Steve and others) and the owners. The lawyer agrees to take the case and will only charge a fee if a settlement is reached or if they have to go to court. Steve and the others agree to this arrangement. The lawyer plans to find out the owners' name within half an hour and will send them a message. He will also assess the value of the ship and its cargo and get an estimate. Steve and the others are staying aboard their boats, the Adventurer and the Follow Me. The lawyer notes that they are mariners and asks how much they think they should get for the boat and cargo. Steve's name is Stephen Chapman, and the lawyer recognizes that there should be a significant amount of money owed to them due to high lumber prices and the boat being loaded with cargo. The boys are discussing the possibility of receiving a thousand dollars. Mr. Hyatt believes they can expect that amount. Joe thinks it's a lot of money for an old schooner like the Catspaw. Steve thinks it might be worth more, around fifteen hundred dollars, considering the cost of the schooner and the lumber on board. The other boys are surprised by the amount, but Steve suggests they decide what to do with the money when they receive it. They all agree it should be divided up proportionally. Steve presents his idea, but it is not mentioned what it is. The club has been successful and had some adventures. They want to make the club a permanent affair. They decide to save the money instead of spending it and put it in the club treasury. They discuss plans for next summer. The group of friends discuss how much money they spent on their recent cruise and decide that they would have spent that money regardless of whether they went on the cruise or stayed at home. They spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning their boats. They have dinner and go to a movie before going to bed early. They express a desire to continue their adventures and suggest having a meeting during Christmas vacation to discuss their summer activities. They plan to save some money for an annual banquet for the Adventure Club of America. On December 23rd, at 6 o'clock post meridian, Steve, Joe, and Wink went to Lawyer Hyatt's office. Mr. Hyatt received a telegram from Barrows and Leland, agents for the owners of the schooner Catspaw in Norfolk, Virginia. The telegram contained an offer of settlement for the boys' claim. Mr. Hyatt explained that he couldn't advise them to accept or reject the offer, but he warned them that taking the case to court would be expensive and time-consuming. He mentioned that the value of the Catspaw and its cargo is more than the offer, but owners typically don't pay the full value of salvaged property. Steve asked about the offer, and Mr. Hyatt revealed that it is not for a thousand dollars as they had hoped. Steve was disappointed by this news. The Adventure Club members receive a telegram offering them $4,761. They wire the good news to Neil and set off for New York. The boats part ways off Bay Shore and the Adventure docks in the yacht basin. Two days later, they receive the money. Perry makes a closing remark from the train platform. He is excited for the next trip of the Adventure Club. The story ends with a note about the Project Gutenberg ebook and its availability.
