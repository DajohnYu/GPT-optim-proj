    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to steer the voice of the generated audio opens up a lot of possibilities for richer audio experiences. There are many use cases such as:\n",
    "- **Enhanced Expressiveness**: Steerable TTS allows adjustments in tone, pitch, speed, and emotion, enabling the voice to convey different moods (e.g., excitement, calmness, urgency).\n",
    "- **Language learning and education**: Steerable TTS can mimic accents, inflections, and pronunciation, which is beneficial for language learners and educational applications where accurate intonation and emphasis are critical.\n",
    "- **Contextual Voice**: Steerable TTS adapts the voice to fit the contentâ€™s context, such as formal tones for professional documents or friendly, conversational styles for social interactions. This helps create more natural conversations in virtual assistants and chatbots.\n"
