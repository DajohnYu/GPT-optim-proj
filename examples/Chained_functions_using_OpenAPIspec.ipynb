The OpenAPI spec was created using `gpt-4`. The spec is then transformed into a set of function definitions that can be supplied to the Chat completion API. The model, based on the provided user instruction, generates a JSON object containing the necessary arguments to call these functions. It's important to note that the Chat completions API does not execute the function; instead, it generates the JSON that you can use to call the function in your own code. \n","\n","OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a universally accepted standard for describing the details of RESTful APIs in a format that machines can read and interpret. It enables both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without direct access to the source code. The specification outlines the details of API endpoints, the operations they support, the parameters they accept, the requests they can handle, the responses they return, their security schemes, and more. OpenAPI specs are typically defined in JSON or YAML formats and can be used for a variety of purposes such as generating interactive documentation, automating code generation, facilitating testing, and more. By establishing a universal language for APIs, OpenAPI Spec ensures that APIs are portable and interoperable across different ecosystems. This makes OpenAPI an excellent candidate for integration with OpenAI's function-calling capabilities.\n","\n","This notebook is divided into two main sections. The first section involves converting a sample OpenAPI spec into a list of function definitions along with their expected arguments. This is done by parsing the OpenAPI spec and extracting the necessary information. The second section involves taking the list of functions generated in the first step, along with a user instruction, and executing the functions sequentially. This is done by feeding the function definitions and the user instruction to the Chat completion API, which generates the JSON objects for function calls."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"cell_id":"bf983b3e199d4ea6a2718e58a141bd88","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":10617,"execution_start":1697419508239,"source_hash":"d6b9a6d3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[33mDEPRECATION: nb-black 1.0.7 has a non-standard dependency specifier black>='19.3'. pip 23.3 will enforce this behaviour change.
