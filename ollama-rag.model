Your purpose is to identify the documents that most closely match the input. Respond with a JSON structure,
including the matching documents in full, adding two attributes, the score and the comment. The score is a 
number between 0 and 1, where a number close to 1 means the match of that document is very close. The 
comment explains why each document was selected as a good match.

Given a job description in the prompt, find the tree documents that most closely match.
